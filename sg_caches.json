[{"id":7278074,"code":"GC8A37G","name":"Walkabout Pang Sua","geocacheType":3,"containerType":2,"difficulty":2.0,"terrain":3.0,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":5,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.3815,"longitude":103.765867,"ownerId":"PRVXB93","ownerName":"treasuretortoise","placedDate":"2019-06-29","lastFoundDate":"2021-08-16","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC8A37G","description":"Pang Sua. A rather unfortunate name due to how close it sounded to a \"bad\" word in Hokkien, my research about the name told me that Pang Sua probably means \"weighting sand\" in Hokkien. It seems that in the past, sand transporting lorries which were suspected of carrying more than the stipulated limit were escorted over to this area for weight tests, and that gave it the name. Anyway, about the cache. First thing to know: this multi-cache is over 7km long.  On foot, you will probably require around 3 hours from start to finish. I recommend bicycles. Also, the last WP and cache position do not have streetlights, so unless you are very brave, you should start this cache earlier in the day, or split it into multiple days. And bring water. Lots of it. The T3 rating for this cache is not just for the length. Please attempt to retrieve the cache in the day, and preferably with a friend.  We start this cache in the revamped Pang Sua Pond. Built in the 1990s, this stormwater collection pond, which collects rainwater runoff from the surrounding catchment and pumps the water to Upper Seletar Reservoir for treatment and storage, has undergone landscaping enhancements so residents in the area can take part in more recreational activities there. After reopening in 2017, Pang Sua Pond now features Singapore's second-largest man-made floating wetland after the Sengkang Floating Wetland in Punggol Reservoir. One of the highlights of the pond\u2019s facelift is its new 480m boardwalk that\u2019s suspended up to seven metres above the waters. From Pang Sua Pond we will follow Pang Sua Canal all the way till it meets Kranji Reservoir. NEW: Only 7 out of the 9 waypoints are needed for the coordinates, just in case some of them are unavailable. See bottom of listing for details.  WP1: Performance Stage  N 1\u00b0 22.890' E 103\u00b0 45.952'  We begin at the posted coordinates, on the multi-purpose stage on the pond. On the stage there is an electric box with letters on it.  Behind the red rectangle are 3 letters.\r To get the value of A, take the first letter and convert it into a number (a = 1, b = 2, etc).  WP2: Scenic Bridge N 1\u00b0 22.936' E 103\u00b0 45.984' We then move on to the wooden bridge over one of the canals supplying this pond with water. The bridge is held up by supports that look like this:  Let B be the number of supports like that in the picture, on both side of the bridge. \r (B is an even number)  WP3: Pond Gym  N 1\u00b0 22.974' E 103\u00b0 45.919' The next WP is located outside the gym along the pond. There are several lampposts that looks like halos here (an example will be the one marked L2\/1). You need to find out which company's name is at the top of the lampposts. The eagle-eyed will be able to spot it from ground level, but it is more fun to go up a level and see it from above. From this position you will get a good view at the entire pond too.  Let C be the number of letters in the company's name covered by the blue rectangle.  WP4: Rail Corridor Test Track N 1\u00b0 22.732' E 103\u00b0 45.617' Time to wave goodbye to Pang Sua Pond and head over the Rail Corridor Test Track nearby. This 400m-long \"test track\" is located on the Rail Corridor and its goal is to test out various surface materials to see which is the most suitable to make the future Rail Corridor trail safer and more resilient. There is one part that actually glows in the dark:  Of course, as stated earlier, I do not recommend doing this cache at night. I heard that the glow is overrated anyway. Your goal here is to find a rock resembling that in the photo below. The rocks here are marked with numbers, find the number on this rock in the orientation in this photo:  Let D be the number on this rock covered by the red rectangle.  WP5: Pang Sua Bridge N 1\u00b0 23.017' E 103\u00b0 45.369' In the past there used to be an old deteriorated bridge here, and the canal forced citizens on either side to take a detour around when they needed to cross it. On 2019, with the cooperation of NParks, the PUB and the Land Transport Authority, the bridge was finally restored, improving accessiblity for the residents around the area. Along the bridge are 4 lighting rods on poles. Go to any of them and read the letters and numbers printed on them.  Let E be the number covered by the red rectangle, all 4 poles carry this same number.  WP6: Yew Tee Flyover N 1\u00b0 23.355' E 103\u00b0 45.108' Time for a little \"spelunking\". This WP is located underneath the Yew Tee Flyover. You can find a toilet, water fountain, vending machine and benches here under the shade, a perfect resting point. Your mission here is to locate one of the plates depicted in the photo below under the flyover:  Let F be the number of letters in the word covered by the blue rectangle.\r (The word starts with \"M\")  WP7: Rock Stream N 1\u00b0 23.964' E 103\u00b0 45.109' The section of the canal here have been converted into a rock stream to give it a more natural look as well as providing birds with places to stand on. Your task here is to count the number of rocks here. This little guy here circled in green may give some trouble:  Honestly, from this side I can't really tell if there are two rocks or if it is one cracked rock, and I am too lazy to actually go to the other side to see. So for this cache let's just treat it as one single rock. The other rocks should be simpler to count. Let G be the number of rocks in the canal here.\r (G is a multiple of 4, just bruteforce this one if you have problem here)  WP8: Fishing Deck N 1\u00b0 24.099' E 103\u00b0 45.140'  This little fishing and viewing deck is pretty popular with residents, joggers, and fishing enthusiasts. The railings are designed in a way that allow fishermen to stick their rods through and let them rest on the horizontal beams. Very smart! Go under the roof and count the numbers of wooden planks in it you can see. Let H be the number of visible wooden planks in the roof. \r (H is a prime number)  WP9: Dead End N 1\u00b0 25.226' E 103\u00b0 44.371'  The final stretch. And a really long one too. The direct path to it will most likely be blocked by a construction site, but there is another path that takes you on a tour of some really cool vehicles (don't take any photos through, use common sense). After enjoying the view of Kranji Reservoir, inspect the pole with the camera on it. I initially wanted this place to be the GZ but cameras make me nervous.  Let I be the month number covered by the blue rectangle.\r (Example: January = 1, December = 12)  The Cache N 1\u00b0 25.XXX' E 103\u00b0 44.YYY' To get XXX, substract 169 from the first 3 digits of (A*B*C*D*E*F*G*H*I). To get YYY, add 390 to the next 3 digits of (A*B*C*D*E*F*G*H*I). The hint for the cache location is within the geochecker:   This cache container can hold cards. If there is any unwanted cards you are going to throw away, feel free to bring some along and stuff them into the cache. This multi-cache is designed to be modular. If you find any problems with any of the stages, tell me about it and I will jettison it from the multi-cache.   Alternate means of deriving the coordinates (in case one\/two WP are unavailable): 1. Go to: https:\/\/asecuritysite.com\/encryption\/shamir_decode 2. Paste these into \"Secret shares\": 0{A}aX4fL8dlDRWiMb9ZQwx+l33q6MaFCmyl9566ig==\r 0{B}yM7kp3tEDHM7\/0Q0eRYwwuYt1Bu0D44UYFoU5w==\r 0{C}dAuYMjFQ3dvSVQfPDxg76JmqyTrA7OwhVScc+g==\r 0{D}R5h+io0I63SOzoGv4xHOIagT3+reBUOncTXhcA==\r 0{E-100}TGat5cDFEnrzo\/ziy4iBA\/h3LfDj2yDM0RAgnQ==\r 0{F}hoya2vMdPIdE9Kb1xFR3p9sPDhhmuPF7UQ65vw==\r 0{G}rPu2SkXjnKXCqugzSLAqHfjxSCdo4seYkHkUtQ==\r 0{H}CVPJkWFCm4KtZgb9zExpfFquuP\/CStrPYvnAcg==\r 0{I}wHjjcgbfOocY7bnCor8801U0Ii1Y44qoainbNA== 4. Replace the letters in curly brackets with the solutions from the WPs and remove the curly brackets. Do any maths within the curly brackets. If the number only has 1 digit add a \"0\" before it.\r For instance: if A = 1, replace \"0{A}aX4fL8dlDRWiMb9ZQwx+l33q6MaFCmyl9566ig==\" with \"001aX4fL8dlDRWiMb9ZQwx+l33q6MaFCmyl9566ig==\".\r If E = 150, replace \"0{E-100}TGat5cDFEnrzo\/ziy4iBA\/h3LfDj2yDM0RAgnQ==\" with \"050TGat5cDFEnrzo\/ziy4iBA\/h3LfDj2yDM0RAgnQ==\". 5. Omit any lines with values you do not know. Only 7 lines are needed. Make sure there are no blank lines. 6. Press \"Determine\" and scroll to the bottom of \"Reconstructed\" for the coordinates! Please use this only as a backup in case 1\/2 of the WPs are unavailable!\r    ","hint":"","total_found":"11","total_did_not_find":"4"},{"id":8406592,"code":"GC9GZHA","name":"RAMS   - The Black Box","geocacheType":2,"containerType":6,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.3789,"longitude":103.769533,"ownerId":"PR19BDJQ","ownerName":"sayang_y","placedDate":"2021-10-02","lastFoundDate":"2023-04-02","lastFoundTime":"18:34:27","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9GZHA","description":"A long Pedestrian Overhead Bridge and covered link way to the bus stop and Pang Sua Pond.

This is a simple multi-cache that will take you around the church, along the path that depicts the story of Jesus using statues and sculptures like the one below...   \r Opening hours for the church are from 9am - 10pm, and you can find parking inside the church. Do avoid hours when they have mass, you can check on this website.  You can check your answers for GZ on Geochecker.com. We hope you enjoy the walk, do share pictures and BYOP!   EDIT: sirhcoey has shared the following very interesting information about the church (you can actually find it in the logs below but I thought I'd bring it up to the description for easier reading): Fellow geocachers who may be interested in a little bit of Singapore history, you may want to check out a tombstone that resides on the grounds of St.Joseph's Church.\r In 1854-56, Alfred Russel Wallace, naturalist and compatriot-friend of Sir Charles Darwin, visited Singapore and painted an interesting account of the town and of tigers and durians.\r \"The Malay Archipelago\" can be read here: (visit link)\r In his account of Singapore, he mentions a missionary in Bukit Timah, which is the present St. Joseph's church, and his friend, Father Anatolius Maudit.\r The sincere and respectful visitor may wish to visit Father Anatolius' tombstone in the church cemetery, and experience this little bit of Singapore history.\r Had wanted to plan a cache here before so here's sharing the info. \r ZacharyKZH has also shared more information about the waypoints you would take to gather the clues for GZ: From the name of the waypoints, I'm probably right to say that the path in which we will be walking down to collect the required numbers is crafted based on the Via Dolorosa (Latin for \"The Way of Sorrows\"), which is the actual route Jesus took from the time he was condemned to death to they place where he died on the Cross. The actual Via Dolorosa is in Jerusalem and is marked by 9 stations (called the Stations of the Cross), each representing a geographical location in the city where a significant event along Jesus's cross-bearing walk to Calvary occurred. Here, of course, the walk isn't as long, but you'll note that the plaques are labelled with Roman Numerals, each corresponding to the actual station number in Jerusalem.\r Thanks for interesting bit of info, sirchoey, it is interesting to note that Wallace mentioned this place in his book. He was a great naturalist and biologist, and the Wallace Education Centre at the nearby Dairy Farm Road was named in his honour as he has indeed done some of his work in the Bukit Timah area. He also lends his name to the Wallace Line, which is an imaginary line drawn across the Malay Archipelago. This line is bio-geographical line and the separates the Asian and Australian eco-zones. Flora and fauna on both sides of the line have distinctly different characteristics due to divergent evolution caused by the lack of land bridges between these two parts of the world. \r Thank you sirhcoey & ZacharyKZH for sharing so much about the church! :)","hint":"outstanding tree","total_found":"39","total_did_not_find":"7"},{"id":3590006,"code":"GC4A9FJ","name":"My Boleh Cache","geocacheType":8,"containerType":3,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":2.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.401467,"longitude":103.768133,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2013-04-21","lastFoundDate":"2021-05-23","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC4A9FJ","description":"Let trace a bit back to the history of the earliest native settlement on this island.\r   The first native King of this island - Sri Tri Buana (Sang Nila Utama) (1299\u20131347 AD) was a prince from Palembang and was then the capital of the diminishing Srivijayan Empire.

This cache will probably require\r substantial time in preparation and some work \u2018in the\r field\u2019.   \r    February 12th, 1942 \"Ah, there you are. I have good news and bad\r news \u2013 mostly bad news and that means some work for you. As\r you know, Bukit Timah has been overrun along with most of our\r vehicles, ammunition and water. Our boys fought bravely but the\r odds were overwhelming. Latest estimate is that we have less than a\r week\u2019s worth of water left and Percy has put a ring defence\r around the city. \u201cOne of the last units left at Bukit\r Timah were our mates in SIGINT, Jones and SamsonThe runner sent\r with the retreat order never returned and we assumed they\u2019d\r been captured. Then 2 hours ago we heard Lieutenant Jones almost\r made it back from behind enemy lines. He was shot by sniper fire\r only yards from our forward gunner. The gunners pulled him out of\r the line of fire along with a large sealed duffel bag of equipment\r which he made them promise to pass on to us. Jones must have given\r him a scare, grabbed him by the collar, gave him the bag, and\r pushed a few sheets of paper into his trouser pocket, while he gave\r the gunner his dying words. \u201cMachine 29, come back to me\r Charlie.\r Rotor's edge rails papa. Ring 2-25-8.\r Four plugs 21 match 39.\r Started first time with key 37.\u201d You\u2019d be tempted to pass them off as\r half-conscious ramblings and that is obviously the story Jones and\r Samson had agreed just in case, but he was deathly serious \u2013\r if you\u2019ll excuse the pun. He made the gunner repeat the\r phrase until he was word perfect - every word. And he made him\r promise to burn or eat the papers if he was caught. Then he\r collapsed and never regained consciousness. When the gunner\u2019s officer saw the seal\r on the duffel bag, he sent the gunner to us post haste. Poor chap\r was almost neurotic by the time we could give him a cup of tea but\r he is certain he\u2019ll never forget that phrase. He handed over\r the bag and the few sheets of paper \u2013 a coded message, a\r burnt scrap of newspaper, and \u2026 a crossword puzzle. Here\u2019s the message:\r ====================================== SIGINTMC TO MCGOC 0130 =82= EBG-PTL \r AZCGI QMUBJ BQXOC XYUSP KAABE\r VVYAW MUSEW QLMJH ZECMI HDUMR\r NAZHV ICYVQ ONVFI NURDD ABPDQ\r DXIFZ ZLGJB BPTUI WBBOQ GGOWC\r XTRSY SJEMA MJQUO TXVIY KNJKK\r RDXAS DLBEM UFKSU VMJBU RULVO\r OZPWO GXKQU IESMC YJZSO SWRWC\r LJNKV MEWWA DXNAA QUNRJ WGLNP\r KNXEX HTQZP KBSMI HPFPM WZXIE\r WRNSF XZNSR UWLPP ARIPK RPTPU\r UFLTG UKKPJ ROPYB KWRXV FRYJI\r XEFLS CEPGL HGUKW YLKTM ZPBJQ\r OYOQI OYURQ XIKWC RUULS XMACW\r PDUMR DPXSY ERSOS MOJBN GZSUY\r STVCT MYHBR MONFM DGESL ZCCKL\r DNJLE CYXIG RJZTU XGWPM CYAGR\r SPVDY SMTBL\r ====================================== ... and here\u2019s the crossword puzzle, 3\r sheets on lined paper \u2026    The gunner\u2019s sorry about the tea stains\r too. I mean no disrespect, but there wasn\u2019t a chance he was\r going to crack the crossword in his state and the bag still had the\r seal so no security breach. On the other hand, I\u2019ve heard the\r initials BP whispered of you, so hoping you can still solve the odd\r cryptic \u2013 and you\u2019d have to admit this one looks pretty\r odd. Samson always was a bit of a cryptic nut \u2013 a very\r \u2018punny\u2019 person \u2026 ah yes \u2026 poor chap. At\r this point I guess we have to presume he\u2019s kicked the old\r bucket. Seriously though, I\u2019d guess he\u2019d been working\r on this one for a while \u2013 maybe it was his way of remembering\r operational code-words or something. Anyway, he\u2019s used it in\r the 20 hours or so they must have been stuck in the back of that\r tunnel \u2013 so just maybe there was some kind of plan in his\r crazy head. No doubt they destroyed all their own coding machines\r but it looks like they found this box afterwards and it was\r obviously too important to leave behind. We don\u2019t know how he\r got it, but it looks pretty dirty, as if it was buried. There seem\r to be some other papers in the bag, more coded messages but\r I\u2019m pretty sure they aren\u2019t as important as what you\r now have. By the way, I wish I had more time to help you\r but let me give you my thoughts on this. I think there is some kind of plan in\r Samson\u2019s mind. The phrase from Jones seems to fit with the\r crossword and it seems to be the initial settings for the machine.\r The box is German, marked \u201cWehrmacht\u201d - Army. And I\r think \u201829\u2019 means 29 Down. I think that one should be\r easy enough. There are also 2 wheels marked B & C and 5 wheels\r marked I to V, and there are rings on each which can be set up.\r There are also some patch cords, but only 4 on this one are in\r usable condition. I think you need to work out what wheels go in\r the machine and in what positions. What else now. Oh yes! That newspaper \u2026\r just a burnt scrap. Didn\u2019t make much sense of it myself. A\r page from the Straits Times of 8th of December, 1941\r \u2013 the afternoon edition I guess. I remember it has some\r really interesting information like how the Japanese embassy in\r London was discovered burning documents \u2026 before the attacks\r on Pearl Harbour and Malaya. But there\u2019s an arrow drawn on it\r pointing off the scrap and some references: 21D, 22A, 1D, 7D, 1A,\r 11D. You\u2019d better see if you can work out what it was\r pointing to, so try to find a back issue somewhere \u2013 \u2026\r December seems such a long time ago \u2026 they might still have\r one in a museum!  On another matter \u2026 No doubt you\r realize that if Percy has to surrender then we\u2019ll have to\r destroy everything before hostilities cease. In that case,\r we\u2019ll revert to the Pencil and Paper Code. I thought\r you\u2019d like to be reminded of how it runs \u2013 we may need\r to send some urgent messages before final deactivation of our\r forces \u2013 and then around whatever camps too I guess.\r I\u2019ve brought along page 23 from the training manual just in\r case you need to brush up.  Look, I have to go now. But when I get a\r chance I\u2019ll try to work on this as well. If I come up with\r anything I\u2019ll let you know somehow, maybe I\u2019ll have to\r just leave a message somewhere for you to pick up.  \r     Additional notes: This cache is intended to help you learn a\r little about the Fall of Singapore, an event that Churchill\r described as the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British\r history (try Wikipedia: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org). You will get to visit a fascinating museum\r where an important event took place. (The sign now has charges for\r admission but in fact admission is free up until the 65th\r anniversary of the Fall of Singapore, 15 Feb 2007). Did you know that cryptic crosswords were used\r to find and test potential cryptologists? Rest easy, for this one\r you can take longer than the 12 minutes the potential recruits were\r usually given. In order to solve this puzzle fully, you will\r need to find a way to decode the German cipher machine signals.\r There are several web-based simulators around, but I found one to\r download at http:\/\/users.telenet.be\/d.rijmenants\/index.htm.(You\r might have to solve the crossword to work out which one to\r use!) Once you have the crossword solved and the\r first message decoded you should be able to use your solutions to\r decode the remaining messages \u2018in the field\u2019 using\r pencil and paper. Further note ... the Decoy micro disappeared and\r it is not worth replacing. If you get to that point then 'Bang!'\r consider yourself booby-trapped! Further note June-2011. I have uploaded the artwork for the\r micro (and the decoy) as it seems like the micro location might be\r demolished in the near future. Enjoy!

One of my favorite part about Geocaching is that it brings me out to very interesting places that I may not have the motivation to visit if not for the caches, so I thought that it is a pity that the caches had to be archived (although understandable). Luckily, virtual stages can still be set within these places. This multi-cache will bring you to five four different quarries within no-cache zones, and the cache itself is located outside the zones. Geologically, the core of Singapore comprises a granite complex, called the Bukit Timah Granite. In more central parts of Singapore, including Bukit Batok and Bukit Timah, this granite was exposed during the last century by quarrying. Abandoned quarries collected rainwater, eventually forming these scenic lakes. The quarries in Bukit Gombak rest on the Gombak Norite, a geological formation that predates the Bukit Timah Granite and rests on it, but for more information on it you should visit the Earthcache there (which you can also go for if you haven't yet). The quarries you need to visit for this cache are:  Singapore Quarry Hindhede Quarry Poh Hin Quarry (the one in Bukit Batok Nature Park) Gammon Quarry (AKA Little Guilin) Seng Chew Quarry  Dairy Farm Quarry is not included as it is filled up with earth and not opened to hikers anyway. There are also several other quarries nearby like Gali Batu Quarry and Lian Hup Quarry but I am pretty sure they are not opened to public. You can visit the quarries in any order, but it is recommended that you visit the 3 in the east first. The cache is located close to Little Guilin and Seng Chew Quarry, so you should leave them for last. The total distance of this multi-cache is around 9km, but with how far the waypoints are, you can just take public transport between certain waypoints, making it much faster to complete. Still, you should bring along plenty of water. Two of the stages is only open from 7am to 7pm, so you should only do the cache in the day. The last 2 waypoints can also prove difficult if you visit them at night. This multi-cache is a little tricker than usual, but still simple enough that you can figure out what to do on site.  Singapore Quarry N 1\u00b0 21.410' E 103\u00b0 46.314'  One of three disused quarries around Bukit Timah Hill, Singapore Quarry is last of them to be rehabilitated after operations ceased in late 1970s. After a period of rehabilitation allowing vegetation and wildlife to return, the quarry recovered enough from the destructive quarrying activities to reopen in 2009 as a freshwater wetland park, complete with a viewing platform as well. There used to be a geocache here that I believe to be disguised as a no-smoking sign. It had long since gotten missing and archived, but if you open up Google Streetview here, you can see a slightly crooked no-smoking sign that isn't here anymore. If that is the cache, then it had been immortalized within the servers of Google. Isn't that incredible? Singapore Quarry only opened from 7am-7pm.   Look closely at the \"twisted steel guardians\" here and find the 3-digit number on some of them, not all of them have the number. Let A be this 3-digit number.\r (The sum of the 3 digits is 10)  Hindhede Quarry N 1\u00b0 20.956' E 103\u00b0 46.493'  The Hindhede Quarry, named after Danish civil engineer Jens Hindhede who was was a businessman and tea farmer in Singapore and Malaysia in the 20s and 30s, used to be a secret haunt for rock climbers and swimmers. The quarry was declared off-limits in 1997 as its rapidly rising waters became a cause for safety concerns. It reopened as a proper nature park in 2001, but the quarry cliff and lake can now only be appreciated from afar, from the safety of a lookout platform. There is also another \"secret\" view of the quarry if you approach it from above from the path to the radio station, but make sure to stay away from the edge if you do! Hindhede Nature Park, where the quarry is located in, is only opened from 7am-7pm.   Find the \"protector from thunder\", along its surface are letters and a 3-digit number repeated throughout. Let B be this 3-digit number.\r (The sum of the 3 digits is 10)\r (It's not a date, look closer)  Poh Hin Quarry N 1\u00b0 21.041' E 103\u00b0 45.881'  The abandoned quarry Bukit Batok Nature Park is built around. Some people claim that Bukit Batok means \"Coughing Hill\" in Malay, refering to the sound of explosives historically used at Little Guilin, but there are others who claim otherwise. A story has it that the hill resembled a skull top and \"batok\" could also be construed to mean \"skull top\", scary. At least we can be sure that it isn't named after the English word for a smelly body part. This park is in fact the place for Singapore's third geocache, but it was muggled and archived within days of publish without a single find. While you are here, you can also check out the memorial plaque identifying the site where Japanese soldiers built a shrine at the top of Bukit Batok to commemorate their dead during World War II.

Little Guilin\u2019s highest point reaches 133m, making it the second tallest hill in Singapore after Bukit Timah Hill. Parts of the 1998 local drama \"The Return of the Condor Heroes\", starring Fann Wong and Christopher Lee, was filmed here.   At the coordinates you should find a large black boxy structure near the edge. The path over to it should not bring you close to the edge, but watch your footing. Count the number of rivets (look at the photo below) on the TOP SURFACE of the black boxy structure. There is only 1 row of rivets on the top surface and it is on the side away from the edge.  Let D be the number of rivets on the top surface of the structure. WARNING: WATCH YOUR FOOTING! The structure is close to the edge and you don't have to go too close to count the rivets. And for heaven's sake don't do this WP at night. I am not going to be reponsible if you fall into the quarry.  Seng Chew Quarry N 1\u00b0 21.673' E 103\u00b0 45.225'  The not-so-secret little quarry that is an optional location for the Earthcache nearby. A little north of this place there used to be an abandoned building thought by some to be a blast shelter, once featured by the One\u00b0 North Explorers. It has long since collapsed, and if you look to the left while approaching the quarry you can see a little piece of a wall. I heard from a little bird that if you have the courage to bash your way up the north slope (I didn't), you will come across the rest of the ruins.   Look closely at the L fence post closest to the fish (or the one just left of the drain when approaching the quarry). Count the number of screws and holes on it and add them together.  Adding the number of screws and holes ensure that even if a screw falls out the sum will not change. The photos below shows examples of the screws and holes.  Let E be the sum of the numbers of screws and holes on this post.\r (E is an even number)\r (Don't forget the hard-to-see hole above the bottommost screw) Once again, watch your footing. Quarries are known to be far deeper than they look. Seng Chew Quarry is no longer open to the public. Ignore this waypoint.

Two soldiers scanned the little house, demanding the whereabouts of a certain Chun. Without a word she was led like a lamb to slaughter. Her sisters clung to each other and watched her leave. \r Her mind was blank and she feared the worst. Upon reaching a house, she was quietly ushered in by a pair of elderly servants . She was made to bathe, change into a simple outfit and fed. All of 17, Chun was a prisoner, a frightened bird in a cage, waiting to meet her captor. \r That evening, she found herself facing him. Chun's instinct was to make a dash, but she remained rooted as she knew her escape would mean the end of her sisters. Arai Kintaro introduced himself; he had noticed her while she worked at the invader's sewing workshop. From here forth she was to be called Haruko - Japanese for spring child. \r Haruko was well taken care of at the Kovan Road bungalow which the Japanese had chosen to make his home in. She later learnt that so was her family . Arai was kind and gentle towards her, but it didn't change the fact that she was captive solely for his entertainment. \r Time passed. Though she was no longer prohibited from stepping out of the house, Haruko did not feel like running away. She was even occasionally permitted to visit her family further down along the same road . While much of the population suffered horrifically, Haruko led a cloistered n somewhat comfortable life. Against her will, Haruko found in herself strange conflicting feelings for Arai. \r Only today, 75 years on, has Chun mustered the strength to relate this \"shameful\" tale for the first time. As profoundly as it may have scarred her, in the course of history and the struggles of our island, it is but a line on a page. The page is turned, the chapter closed.

Three different rock formations in Singapore were believed to have been formed at this time: the Sajahat formation (the oldest formation, named for Pulau Sajahat where they occur); some volcanic rock outcrops on Pulau Tekong and smaller islands in the northeast; and of course, the Gombak norite.     \r Gombak norite is been found here at Bukit Gombak and to a lesser extent at Bukit Panjang, where they have been quarried extensively in the last century, forming the picturesque landscapes that now dot the Bukit Batok HDB town, including the nearby Little Guilin. The Gombak norite is surrounded by the more recent Mesozoic (250 \u2013 65 million years ago) rock formations. In the west, it is bordered by the Jurong Formation (made up of sedimentary rocks) and the Bukit Timah granite batholith in the east, which is the largest rock formation in Singapore, providing the bedrock for most of the island. \r The Gombak norite is of mixed composition, ranging from its namesake noritic rocks to gabbro (a rock similar to norite, but with a slightly different chemical composition). The Gombak norite formation rests on top of the Bukit Timah Granite, which means that the norite was pushed up to form the outcrops seen today by the granite due to tectonic activity. At some points, the granite has cut and assimilated into the norite formation, and both of these observations provide proof that the Gombak norite predates the Bukit Timah granite.  Norite and Gabbro \r At this point, you are probably wondering what gabbro and norite are, and how they are formed. Let us begin by describing these two rocks. Geologists describe gabbro and norite as \u201cintrusive, mafic, igneous rocks\u201d, which is quite a daunting set of terms if you are not trained in the Earth Sciences. Now, let\u2019s tackle the terms one at a time: \r 1)      Igneous: There are three main groups of rocks: Igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rocks, from the Latin ignis, meaning fire, are rocks that a formed from the cooling and subsequent solidification of magma in the Earth\u2019s mantle or lava from volcanos. Igneous rocks are by far the most abundant rocks in the Earth\u2019s crust, making up 90 \u2013 95%of its volume. Familiar igneous rocks would be ubiquitous granite, basalt, gabbro, andesite and quartzite.   Fig 2: Basalt - an extrusive, mafic, igneous rock  2)      Intrusive: Igneous rocks can be further divided into two types, intrusive (or plutonic) and extrusive. Intrusive rocks are formed when magma cools within the Earth\u2019s crust and some of them are subsequently pushed up to the surface due to tectonic activity. The defining feature of intrusive rocks is that they tend to be course-grained due to their slow cooling. Examples of intrusive rocks are granite and gabbro. In sharp contrast are the extrusive rocks, which are formed when lava which erupts from volcanos cool quickly on the Earth\u2019s surface. There are normally fine-grained, occasionally with gas bubbles within. Examples include basalt and the beautiful glass-like obsidian. \r 3)      Mafic: Mafic describes the elemental composition of the rock, and refers to the large percentage of iron-magnesium minerals present in the rock and mafic rocks tend to be darker in colour. Mafic comes from the blending of the words MAgnesium and FerrIC (iron-rich), as opposed to felsic rocks (like granite) (FELdspar and SIliCa) which contain more silicon, potassium, sodium and calcium minerals and tend to be lighter in colour. \r So, from the above descriptions, we can conclude that norite and gabbro are iron and magnesium rich rocks formed from the cooling of magma deep in the Earth\u2019s crust. The difference between gabbro and norite lies in the presence of a different forms of a mineral known as pyroxene. Norite contains more orthopyroxenes, while gabbro contains more clinopyroxenes. The difference between the two cannot be easily discernible by the naked eye and can only be seen under a microscope or magnifying lens. For the purposes of this cache, you may assume these two to be one and the same.  The Questions \r At the published coordinates, you will find examples of Gombak Norite rocks protruding from the ground. The quarries in the vicinity (Little Guilin and the Seng Chew Quarry are also excellent examples of the norite formation). I do encourage you explore these abandoned quarry parks if you have the time. But, if you\u2019re in a hurry, just study the rocks in at the published coordinates.\r  \r Your task is to observe the characteristics of the rocks here, and answer the following questions: \r 1.       DESCRIBE the characteristics of the Gombak norite. In particular, pay attention to the colour, roughness, texture, hardness and grain-size of the rocks you see here. You may want to bring a ruler (with at least millimetre markings) to help with the description of the grain-size.\r  \r   Fig. 3: A granite rock\r  \r 2.       The above is a photo of granite, a very common igneous rock found in abundance at nearby Bukit Timah. COMPARE the characteristics of the rocks found here with granite. What similarities and differences can you see? Can you suggest reasons for these similarities and differences? Repeat this task for basalt (Fig. 2). \r 3.       Optional: If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, check out the quarry at this coordinates (trailhead: N01 21.726 E103 45.157, actual location N01 21.674 E103 45.217), which is not too far a hike from the published coordinates (but bring\/wear appropriate gear). You may post a picture of your hike and visit there in the logs. \r Send the answers to me via e-mail to me. I\u2019m not too particular about whether you log first, and e-mail later or vice versa, but as long as I get a response within a reasonable period of time (a week or so) from a log, I won\u2019t delete it.

Popular among hikers for the challenging terrain and distance, several hiking groups regularly organize hikes across the trail with large groups of people. Certain parts of the trail are very close to military training areas, but as long as you stick to the trail it is perfectly fine to hike along it. The waypoints of this multi-cache are simpler and lesser in number so you can focus on the hike. Some things to know about this multi-cache:  The total length of this trail is around 8 to 9 km. On foot, that should take about 3 to 4 hours in total. Split the trail into multiple days if you need to. You can't bring bikes on various parts of this trail, sorry. The earlier parts of the multi-cache are only opened from 7am to 7pm, so please do this cache in the day. Bring plenty of water, 2 bottles preferably. Wear covered shoes\/boots, some parts may be a little muddy. A flashlight is highly recommended, phone lights are probably enough but you can see more with a flashlight. Bring a partner if you can. There are some parts where a bad slip can turn bad. It is probably a good idea to bring along a face mask. Some people may find the GZ rather unhygienic. Most of the waypoints have alternative solutions in case the original solution is unavailable. Highlight the black bars to see them.

Multiply the number by 2 and subtract 1 from it to get A.  WP2: Yellow Posts N 1\u00b0 21.592' E 103\u00b0 46.830'  You will find a group of yellow posts linked by a rusty chain here. Count the number of yellow posts. Don't miss the ones hidden in the trees, as well as the one laying on the grass sideways! You may want to check out the alternative method to make sure your number is correct Let B be the number of yellow posts.\r (B is an odd number) Alternative: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/MuXRRGg.jpg Go the the nearest set of shaft covers to the yellow posts, and read the markings on one of the small round ones (there are 2 there and their markings should be the same. Get the 2-digit number covered by the red square and subtract 3 from it to get B.  WP3: Lamp Post 69 N 1\u00b0 21.920' E 103\u00b0 46.717'  At this waypoint we exit Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and enters Zhenghua Nature Park, a park which serves as a green buffer for the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Zhenghua was the initial name of Bukit Panjang new town when it was built before it was eventually renamed to the original name of the area. It is the Pinyinised version of \"Cheng Hwa\", which was derived from the old road Jalan Cheng Hwa, which in turn was probably named after the old Cheng Hwa Chinese School. You should find an openable gate at the waypoint as shown in the photo. This gate is to prevent wildlife within the park from going onto roads\/residental places. After crossing the gate, look for a lamp post with the funny number 69 on it and look at the label on it (which is upside down for some reason, part of a joke or just a mistake?)  Let C be the number-equivalent of the month covered by the red circle.\r (January = 1, Feburary = 2, etc) Alternative: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AH09RLy.jpg Look for the red sign just after the gate and get the number covered by the blue rectangle. Multiply the number by 2 and subtract 1 from it to get C. From here you can continue on the Pipeline Trail or walk on the paved path in Zhenghua Nature Park. Or you can take a bus if you are tired of walking, there is a lot more coming.   WP4: Chestnut Tower N 1\u00b0 22.686' E 103\u00b0 46.703' A short detour into Chestnut Nature Park and up the observation tower. You can enter Chestnut Nature Park by going under BKE at N01\u00b0 22.614' E103\u00b0 46.595'. There was a cache here that fell victim to the \"Great Archiving\"...  At the top of the tower, look for what is in the photo above and find the hidden number. There is a pair of the object but both of them carry the same number. Let D be the two-digit number covered by the green circle.\r (D is an odd number)  WP5: Upper Zhenghua Nature Park N 1\u00b0 23.095' E 103\u00b0 46.458' There is a toilet within the park nearby and you should probably relieve youself before going further. You will be out of civilisation of a while.  At the wooden stairs at the coordinates, find the company's name on the lights attached to the railings as shown in the photo above. The first and last letters of the company's name are the same. Let E be the number form of the first\/last letter of the company's name.\r (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, etc)  WP6: Prohibited Road N 1\u00b0 24.163' E 103\u00b0 46.412'  You should come across a paved road coming from the prohibited area. Follow the road below the highway and look for the stairs in the photo above at the coordinates. Go to the shaft cover at the top of the stairs and read the markings.  Let F be the number covered by the red rectangle. Alternative: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZYT9PlF.jpg At N 1\u00b0 24.101' E 103\u00b0 46.363', you should be able to find a hard to see flight of stairs. Climb up the stairs till you hit a dead end and inspect the electric boxes\/water meters (?) there. These stairs are very slippery! Move slowly and carefully especially when going down the stairs.There are four of these locked boxes there. All four share the same digit between \"B\" and \"S'. Get the number covered by the green circle and add 3 to it to get F.  WP7: The Climb After the Road N 1\u00b0 24.604' E 103\u00b0 46.368'  You are going to have to cross the road here, there are traffic lights to the left. After crossing the road, go to the shaft cover on the hill's slope depicted on the photo above. Let G be the number formed by the last 2 digits of the year found on the shaft cover.\r (the first 2 digits are \"19\") Alternative: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7HyhTVA.jpg Go to lamp post 100 and get the 2-digit number covered by the red rectangle. Add 19 to it to get G.  WP7: After the Pipe Crossing N 1\u00b0 25.011' E 103\u00b0 46.319'  Another set of exposed pipes marks the final waypoint. You used to be able to walk across the pipes, but now you can no longer do it. You can go left\/right around the fences, go right to find a bridge across the water stream. If you are hardcore you can try the left route where you either have to ford the stream or shimmy past on the fences (which was what I did, since I didn't find the bridge on the other side at first). Find the small rectangle shaft cover at the bottom of the photo above. Let H be the number formed by the last 2 digits of the year found on the shaft cover.\r (the first 2 digits are \"19\") Alternative: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VoWK7E1.jpg Find the larger square shaft cover next to the one in the photo above and get the 3-digit number covered by the red rectangle. Subtract 34 from it to get H.  The Cache N 1\u00b0 25.XXX' E 103\u00b0 46.YYY' To get XXX, add 202 to the first 3 digits of (A*B*C*D*E*F*G*H). To get YYY, add 59 to the next 3 digits of (A*B*C*D*E*F*G*H). The hint for the cache location is within the geochecker:   If there is any problems with any of the waypoints, please inform me and I shall try to provide the solution as soon as I can.

The word \"cipher\" originally means \"zero\", but somehow it came to mean \"encoding\". Since taking up geocaching, I have been introduced to a variety of ciphers, and with deeper research I found their mechanisms to be pretty fascinating. The history behind ciphers can be pretty interesting too. Do you know? What we know today as the Vigen\u00e8re Cipher has not much to do with the person Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re. The Vigen\u00e8re Cipher, once known as \"the indecipherable cipher\", was first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso and is based off the Trithemius Cipher (which is just a Caesar Cipher with the shift increasing by 1 for each letter). It was misattributed to Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re in the 19th century and becamed named after him, shame, because Vigen\u00e8re himself is the father of a cipher that is really interesting too. Anyway, time for puzzles! Many geocache puzzles involving ciphers mostly just revolve around identifying the cipher used and figuring out the key, but these ciphers involve a little more than simply copying and pasting the ciphertext into a decoder. Decoders are still helpful though, some of these ciphers are designed to be solved using them.

Its position, as the finale of the anthology is a meaningful one, as you might surmise from reading the story. The original story (in German) is listed below: \u201cZur Winterszeit, als einmal ein tiefer Schnee lag, mu\u00dfte ein armer Junge hinausgehen und Holz auf einem Schlitten holen. Wie er es nun zusammengesucht und aufgeladen hatte, wollte er, weil er so erfroren war, noch nicht nach Haus gehen, sondern erst Feuer anmachen und sich ein bischen w\u00e4rmen. Da scharrte er den Schnee weg, und wie er so den Erdboden aufr\u00e4umte, fand er einen kleinen goldenen Schl\u00fcssel. Nun glaubte er wo der Schl\u00fcssel w\u00e4re, m\u00fc\u00dfte auch das Schlo\u00df dazu sein, grub in der Erde und fand ein eisernes K\u00e4stchen. \u201eWenn der Schl\u00fcssel nur pa\u00dft!\u201c dachte er, \u201ees sind gewi\u00df kostbare Sachen in dem K\u00e4stchen.\u201c Er suchte, aber es war kein Schl\u00fcsselloch da, endlich entdeckte er eins, aber so klein da\u00df man es kaum sehen konnte. Er probierte und der Schl\u00fcssel pa\u00dfte gl\u00fccklich. Da drehte er einmal herum, und nun m\u00fcssen wir warten bis er vollends aufgeschlossen und den Deckel aufgemacht hat, dann werden wir erfahren was f\u00fcr wunderbare Sachen in dem K\u00e4stchen lagen.\u201d I won\u2019t put in the English translation, because\u2026 well, I want to preserve the authenticity of the story. Google Translate is always available of course, if you are dying to know how the story goes, and more importantly, how it ends. The Cache This cache was created by Lionking8991 and me as a farewell cache to baekno, who will be leaving Singapore very soon. It traces the story of Der goldene Schl\u00fcsse, as best as we can, barring, for instance, that \u201cWinterszeit\u201d doesn\u2019t quite happen in Singapore and no one actually has boxes that requires a goldene Schl\u00fcssel. The way this cache pans out is best discovered on the field, so be prepared the relive the story as you search for the cache. The published coordinates will mark the beginning of the two-part multi-cache, and the needed information for the final will be found there. Post Script The story behind the story is an interesting one. When I first encountered the story, I mentioned it to baekno, who remarked that this must have inspired the sport of geocaching. It was a rather amusing thought, and I wondered whether it could be adapted into a cache. I put some thought into it, and realised that this makes a very nice farewell cache as it will be, perhaps, her last chapter of her geocaching journey in Singapore in the near future.    The story is an interesting one and blends in well with the occasion, as it reminds us that even as we approach the last chapter in the book, the last story to be told, there will always be something else just beyond the last page. So, here is wishing that there will be more stories for all of us beyond this last chapter. Thank you for the help and company in all the strange and exciting adventures we had in Singapore, Malaysia and some say Batam (and even Bintan!), some of which I believe are worthy of becoming folk tales themselves. As we come to the last word of this chapter, all that remains to be said is: have a safe journey back to Germany, continue having fun geocaching and maybe, someday, we will meet again and write the next chapter in this collection of tales.

While it carries the traditions of a sitcom, many unusual elements were used such as flashbacks, quick gags and celebrity cameo appearances.   The series revolves around the Phua family, most notably Phua Chu Kang, a contractor who boasts that he is the \"Best in Singapore, JB, and some say Batam\" - this is despite the fact that he has only two men working for him and they are both inept and lazy.    He is also noted for his famous clich\u00e9 or catchphrase: \"Don't play play\" (pronounce as \"pray pray\" according to his articulation). There is also another famous catchphrase which is being used in his famous 2003 music video called \"PCK Sar-vivor Rap\", that is, \"Use your brain!\" (pronounced as \"blain\").    His personal clothing trademarks are his yellow pair of boots, curly hair, a giant black mole, and long nails on his pinky fingers. Phua Chu Kang is portrayed as an \"Ah Beng\", which is a Singlish slang for a stereotypical, uneducated Chinese gangster, complete with habits such as hoisting one leg up on the seat of a chair when he sits down and growing one long fingernail to scratch his ears.   This cache brings you to the agriculture region of \"Chua Chu Kang\" (sound almost alike). You may spot some of the farmers wearing the same Phua Chu Kang trademark yellow boots (I spotted one while placing this cache).

If the name sounds familiar, it might be because you have watched the award-winning movie \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d, which is based on the story about how he stuttered and overcame his struggle with his speech impediment. Once home to a bus terminal and the headquarters of a very famous fast food restaurant, today, King Albert Park (or KAP, as it\u2019s affectionately known) is an upscale suburb of condominiums and new commercial centres. The Bukit Timah section of the Downtown Line opened in December 2015, bringing better connectivity to the neighbourhood with the opening of the King Albert Park MRT Station. As part of the Art in Transit project, the station features a very delightful set of sculptures and installations within and outside the station. Take a walk around and see if you can spot the answers to the following questions:  Dillenia suffruticosa or the Simpoh Air is perhaps one of the most commonly found wayside shrubs in Singapore. How many different panels (that is, do not double-count panels with the same sketch) describing this plant can you find? The answer is A. How many different plants (again: do not include repeated panels) are described as having parts that are poisonous or toxic? This number is B. There are just under a thousand different plants within the Ficus or Fig Tree genus. How many different Ficus plants are mentioned in the title of the panels? The number is C. (hint: do not count different panels about the same plant AND the state tree of India as part of C)  Rivalling the Ficus in species diversity is this genus of plants that has medicinal value and can even be used to polish sword blades! How many species belong to this genus? Answer: Around DE00 species. This plant has leaves that are literally \u201cafraid of water\u201d or \u201chydrophobic\u201d. How big are its leaves? Answer: FG cm Singapore\u2019s founder has a very beautiful and special plant named after him. H is the number of letters of the name of the part of this plant that produces nectar. Some of the panels also feature some rather fascinating specimens. Bats apparently have whiskers that grow to a remarkable length of IJ inches, while peacocks can have clusters up to KL inches tall.

He was perturbed, nay, you could say quite agitated. In this state, this ritual of pacing the dimensions, circling his desk, brought order and comfort back to him. It allowed the little grey cells to ponder, as one of his friends used to say. First, he thought, those two dead drops by Commander Bond had not been collected (meaning Jio Ka Shing, that Napoleon of Crime, was still not apprehended) and then Operation Pig Pen had gone south. While there were some bright points, such as the recovery of the Spindrift despite the local agents using wrong constants, having one person missing from the recovery team had compromised Pig Pen. He sighed, it was always the small things that caused significant problems, in this case just being off by one agent. The craft had managed to lift off, although its departure was obviously rushed. This haste had meant that not all its sampling arms had been retracted, and something had not been stowed correctly. A jolt, a little turbulence, as the craft lifted back towards the heavens had shaken something loose. But what? And where had it fallen? The only clue to this was the image on the desk, but how to look deeper into the matter, how to shake loose the co-ordinates? It was almost enough to make him see red, but Mycroft did not indulge in emotions. Logic was the key to this thought processes. He was sure that logic would triumph again in this case, once he started to dig into what the image meant and what message it could tell him. Mycroft stopped his perambulations and returned to his desk, picking up the printout of the image. Terrific, he thought, of all the instruments they could have used, this is the only one the team was able to train onto the craft in time. He shrugged. Well, it was better than nothing and he was sure that once he brought his mind to it, the image would open its secrets to him. No point being blue, he thought, better get down to business! If anything, being negative was entirely the wrong direction. He paused. How did that song go? He pursed his lips and started to whistle Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. Now, that was the ticket, he thought, brightening up.

However, during the last decade the park had developed a seedy reputation for being a hive for vice activities during nighttime, causing residents to forbid children from going there. After a 22-month makeover, the park reopened in 2018, now named Marsiling Park.

Yes you need to do bash through and the vegetation is very very thick. look on the ground and you can see the tracks appearing and disappearing in the vegetation. You can feel it under your feet. follow the tracks and you will not be lost.  you would pass by two muddy tunnels during the trekking, the first one in the beginning. After coming out from the second tunnel, you need to walk about 50m, the geocache is on the left side of the track. It is kept in a corroded metal box that looks like an electrical box. We are providing this information upfront as it would be quite hard to find even if you already know.    Option Two - for those who only want to see part of the tracks - you can enter from Clementi Street 14, after the abandoned railway bridge which should not be walked on. Climb the slope after the bridge and you will be already on the tracks. After about 1.5km, would cross one tunnel only, thereafter it is 50m away on the left side.    Option Three - for those who only want to find the geocache - you can enter from Maju Drive, however we will not provide further coordinates or direction on exactly where to enter as it really spoils the fun :) just remember, you will see the tunnel. :)   Background  -  Jurong Railway Line. The Keretapi Tanah Melayu railway from Malaysia used to have an extension branching out from the Bukit Timah railway station to Shipyard Road and Jurong Port via Teban Gardens. This railway extension was intended for goods transportation as Jurong lacked good roads at the time. It was opened in 1965 amid much fanfare, but failed to generate satisfactory traffic. It was consequently closed in early 1990s during the electrification project, and has since been partially dismantled. It is not clear when the railway line was officially ceased operations, but there have been sayings that it was in the mid 1970s. Almost half a century later from its opening, the partial Jurong Railway Line is now an amazing undiscovered treasure for trekkers and adventure seekers in Singapore, overgrown in a myriad of vegetation.  more information on the area: http:\/\/joyloh.com\/blog\/?p=4715 http:\/\/goodmorningyesterday.blogspot.sg\/2008\/05\/ulu-pandan-heritage-trail-9-lost.html","hint":"if you pass by a row of metal shafts on the right side of the tracks, you have missed the geocache!","total_found":"36","total_did_not_find":"3"},{"id":7874969,"code":"GC8Z4B6","name":"Pikasarus's Favorite mode of transport!","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.0,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":6,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.332933,"longitude":103.740717,"ownerId":"PRJW4ZK","ownerName":"kelvinsarus","placedDate":"2020-08-29","lastFoundDate":"2023-04-20","lastFoundTime":"15:03:23","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC8Z4B6","description":"Pokecache series Pikachu, the Mouse Pok\u00e9mon. it electricity-storing pouches on its cheek, whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity.

The forest that lines its banks is considered a mature secondary rainforest and is still dotted with numerous rubber trees and oil palms \u2013 visible reminders of a past when vast areas of Singapore were covered with plantations.  It was formerly known as the Kallang River Reservoir and was planned as an extension of the first reservoir (MacRitchie Reservoir) to meet the increasing demand for Singapore's water supply. The Municipal Commission proposed its construction in July 1902 and the Westminster Construction Company of London was awarded the contract in March 1907. The reservoir was completed in 1910, at a cost of 967,641 Straits dollars, by damming the upper reaches of the Kallang River and was officially opened on 26 March 1912.  Ten years later, the reservoir was renamed the Peirce Reservoir in recognition of Robert Peirce, who was the Municipal Engineer of Singapore from 1901 to 1916. It only acquired its current name in 1975, after the Upper Peirce Reservoir was built.

My father never took my siblings out walking the way he did for me. I wonder whether, during our walks, we ever came here. It's possible that we did. It's not so far away.

Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense (for example, hearing) is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, color or flavor. The word synesthesia comes from two Greek words, syn (together) and aisthesis (perception). Therefore, synesthesia literally means \"joined perception.\" Synesthesia can involve any of the senses. The most common form, coloured letters and numbers, occurs when someone always sees a certain color in response to a certain letter of the alphabet or number. For example, a synesthete (a person with synesthesia) might see the word \"plane\" as mint green or the number \"4\" as dark brown. There are also synesthetes who hear sounds in response to smell, who smell in response to touch, or who feel something in response to sight. Just about any combination of the senses is possible. There are some people who possess synesthesia involving three or even more senses, but this is extremely rare. Synesthetic perceptions are specific to each person. Different people with synesthesia almost always disagree on their perceptions. In other words, if one synesthete thinks that the letter \"q\" is colored blue, another synesthete might see \"q\" as orange.

You may recall the classic nursery rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\", which features \"four and twenty blackbirds \/ Baked in a pie\" and we are then told that \"when the pie was opened \/ The birds began to sing\". While you won't be encountering live animals baked into pastries in this station (thank goodness!), you'll instead find plenty of birds flitting about, and... in fact, there are approximately \"four and twenty\", according to my rough count. These birds are songbirds, drawn from the local tradition of keeping and displaying these beautiful creatures who have quite the vocal range and talent, a practice that lives on in the Kebun Baru - Mayflower area to this day.  However, many of these birds are imported species, and have been dwindling in number in the wild as a result of poaching for the songbird trade. In fact, many species have become illegal to traffic and sell in recent years, and so, let us instead enjoy the beauty of these birds in the wild... or at Mayflower MRT station. And now... about the cache. The Puzzle Your task here is simple - seek out the birds, and solve the puzzle below:   You won't need to enter beyond the fare gates to find them all.

It should also be fairly obvious, especially looking at them on a map, that these two roads were once upon a time a single road, which were at some point split in two.  What might be less obvious, however, is the fact that Bright Hill Drive has been split in two more than once, and that there is a third remnant of Bright Hill Drive hiding in plain sight, not too far away! This multi-cache will take you on a little journey down the history of this unassuming, yet possibly once quite heavily trafficked roadway, visiting five locations, not including GZ. Waypoint #1 - The Clinic and the Squatter Colony - (N 1\u00b0 21.3327', E 103\u00b0 49.926') Standing at this spot, you are at the entrance to the oldest part of Bright Hill Drive, making it\u2019s first appearance (as far as I can tell) in the 1953 1:25,000 topographical map of Singapore.  The old, single-storey buildings you see here, now home to a kindergarten, sit on the site of what used to be a clinic, showing up on street maps as early as 1961, and vanishing about 15 years later in 1984. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to confirm whether the buildings are original, but it seems plausible that they are.  A 1972 article in the Straits Times referred to this clinic as the \u201cBright Hill Drive Outpatient Dispensary and Maternal and Child Health Clinic\u201d. Another article, from 1977, identified it as being one of 22 clinics islandwide specifically addressing the healthcare needs of mothers and their children, under the auspices of the MOH\u2019s Mother and Child Health Department. These clinics aimed to prevent disease and promote and maintain optimal health for mothers and pre-school children, offering family planning care, pre-natal care, prescription of mineral and vitamin supplements, and postpartum aftercare services, etc. By 1980, the clinic had been rebranded a polyclinic, providing more general healthcare services. A New Nation article from March of that year describes how mobile X-ray units mounted on Land Rovers were stationed at various locations, including this clinic, to help screen for tuberculosis in the country.  Clues as to why the clinic was eventually shut down come from a March 1979 article. In this article, Dr Toh Chin Chye, then Health Minister, noted that facilities at the Bright Hill Drive clinic could not be expanded, due to the physical constraints of the site. At the same time, a new polyclinic was being constructed at Ang Mo Kio, which would be completed in two years, and which would provide a wide variety of medical services. The article doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, but one can speculate that with the completion of this polyclinic, need for the Bright Hill Drive clinic diminished, and thus it was closed. Looking across Bright Hill Drive, you see an entrance to the spanking new (as of 2021) Upper Thomson MRT Station. Growing up here in the 1990s, I have the distinct memory of crossing the overhead bridge and seeing a collection of ramshackle zinc huts sitting right where this station entrance is today. Nobody else in my family seems to recall this, not even my parents, who would have been at an age to remember more reliably. Could this be a false memory? Possibly. However, as late as 1971, there existed some 700 acres of squatter land between the fifth and sixth mile markers of Upper Thomson Road (between St Theresa\u2019s Home and where Sin Ming Avenue touches Upper Thomson Road today). Perhaps the zinc huts of my (still dubious) memory were a remnant of some squatters residing formerly on this land? Look for the tall object nearby bearing a large red number. Let this red number be A. Waypoint #2 - Hong Lai Si Temple (N 1\u00b0 21.4442', E 103\u00b0 49.9437') Roughly where there is today the entrance to an HDB car park, there used to run a street named Jalan Cherah. On this street was a Chinese temple called \u201cHong Lai Si Temple\u201d (also spelt \u201cHong Lye See\u201d). Unfortunately, I was able to find hardly any information at all about this temple, other than its name and a few photographs, which I can\u2019t even confirm are really of this temple, since I have only a single source. This is surprising to me, because this temple appears on street maps as recently as 1998, well within my own living memory. Street maps from 1984 when Jalan Cherah still existed, and later from 1991, when a carpark is built where the road used to be:   Photos of Hong Lai Si Temple?   Of course, part of the reason might be my Chinese is horrible, and my researches have thus been limited to material in English. Also, if I were motivated enough to try and seek out and speak to some of the older folks living in the area, I could probably learn a lot more through their oral accounts. Nevertheless, I like to think there is a lesson to be learnt here about the fragility of the present, how we cannot take for granted that things which are obvious and generally understood today will remain so even a decade from now, let alone two or more. We need to start documenting tomorrow\u2019s history today, and moreover think about how these records can stay accessible, trustworthy, and comprehensible to those who many lack today\u2019s contextual knowledge. There is an object on the ground near here bearing the letters SEW. These letters are surrounded by dozens of identical shapes. How many corners do each of these shapes have? Let this number be B. Waypoint #3 - Catholic High Primary? (N 1\u00b0 21.5607', E 103\u00b0 50.001\u2019) Welcome to the other side! You are now standing at what is the newest portion of Bright Hill Drive. I wasn\u2019t able to establish exactly when this segment of the road opened, but the 1988 edition of the Singapore Street Map shows the road for the first time, under construction, while the 1991 edition shows it completed, so it would have been sometime between those two years.   The very next edition of the Street Map, however, in 1993, shows this segment of Bright Hill Drive disconnected from the older segment at Upper Thomson Road, and the two have been disconnected ever since! Why did this happen, and so soon after the road was completed? I have some ideas, but I\u2019m not sure.  Sharp-eyed geocachers may notice something strange about the 1991 street map. At the corner of Bright Hill Drive and Sin Ming Avenue lies not Ai Tong School, but Catholic High Primary! This June 1989 New Paper article describes the completion of a new building at this site for the Primary Section of Catholic High School, noting that it was designed to have a \u201ccastle look\u201d, with \u201ctowers\u201d and \u201cdrawbridges\u201d. Yet just three years later, on 2 July 1992, the school moved out of this building, into its present site at Bishan Street 22. A New Paper article published the next day (which I can\u2019t link to because it is too recent, but can be viewed at dedicated terminals in NLB libraries; references below) describes what the school called its \u201cLong March\u201d, with 2000 primary school students walking 2.5km to their new school building. Ai Tong School then moved into this Bright Hill Drive site just a week later, on 9 July 1992! Talk about efficient! Ai Tong School occupies the same building today, albeit upgraded nearly beyond recognition.  I was not able to confirm exactly why Catholic High School (Primary Section) occupied the Bright Hill Drive site for such a short period before moving again, but common sense leads me to conclude the Bright Hill Drive site was always only a temporary location. During roughly the same period, from 1988, the Secondary Section of Catholic High School had been housed at Bishan Street 12, in today\u2019s Guangyang Primary School building, and this was explicitly a holding site (again, I can\u2019t link to the article because it is too recent). Both the Primary and Secondary Sections moved into their new Bishan Street 22 premises on the same day, reuniting them for the first time in over 10 years. Incidentally, Ai Tong School had also moved around a bit in its long history. Prior to moving into the Bright Hill Drive premises in 1992, it had been located at Ang Mo Kio Ave 3, moving into that site in 1981. Prior to that, it had occupied two other sites, both on Telok Ayer Street. Look for \u201c1253C1\u201d Waypoint #4 - Bright Hill Road (N 1\u00b0 21.6413', E 103\u00b0 50.0947') While doing research for another cache, I came across this picture, which really puzzled me at the time, because it seemed to indicate that Bright Hill Drive once wound all the way to Marymount Road, and I could not imagine how this could be the case, with so many other roads in the way:  A quick perusal through historical street maps and old newspapers, however, made it clear what had happened. A New Nation article from February 1980 described plans for an extension of Bright Hill Drive, which then ended cleanly at Bright Hill Crescent. At the time, the temples and cemeteries on Bright Hill were accessible only via Bright Hill Drive and Sin Ming Road, both of which were in turn accessible only via Upper Thomson Road. During certain festivals, such as Qing Ming, this resulted in terrible congestion, caused by large crowds of devotees and families of the deceased converging on the area. Heavy traffic on Upper Thomson Road during Qing Ming. This was taken at Peck San Teng nearby, rather than at Bright Hill Drive:  Street map from 1981, showing Bright Hill Drive ending cleanly at Bright Hill Crescent:    The Bright Hill Drive extension was completed and opened a year later, on 26 March 1981, costing $1.5m. The 1984 edition of the Street Map shows this completed extension. Bright Hill Drive then pushed on past Bright Hill Crescent, bisecting the Chinese Cemetery, before taking a sharp right turn after Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple, heading towards Marymount Road.  Three grids: one big grid, and two identical small grids. How many squares form the width of the small grid? Let this number be D. Waypoint #5 - The end of the road (N 1\u00b0 21.7972\u2019, E 103\u00b0 50.1558\u2019) We are close to the end of our journey, and the end of Bright Hill Drive. Close to where you stand, Bright Hill Drive took a sharp right turn towards Marymount Road. What happened to this stretch of road?  Well, it became part of Sin Ming Avenue! The 1988 Street Map shows this segment of Bright Hill Drive now separated from Bright Hill Crescent, and the section after Phor Kark See Temple renamed.  Sin Ming Avenue itself was fully completed by the time the 1993 Street Map was published. We can postulate that once that happened, access to Ai Tong School and the temples at Bright Hill could be via Sin Ming Avenue, and access by Bright Hill Drive via Upper Thomson Road was no longer needed, and perhaps no longer desirable, considering it was a longer drive down a narrow road, through a housing estate, hence the splits. The section of Bright Hill Drive connecting to Sin Ming Avenue close to Phor Kark See Temple was renamed Bright Hill Road on 1 August 1995, to avoid confusion with the segment between Upper Thomson Road and Bright Hill Crescent, although the same might be said of the segment at Ai Tong School, and that wasn\u2019t renamed\u2026  And so the history of the two splits.

Consider how much space they take up in land scarce Singapore, and the population it serves, nestled as it is amongst low density private housing. I've lived my whole life in this neighbourhood. I remember being a kid, back when residents in this neighbourhood still tended to be young families. Every evening after school, my siblings and I would convince our grandmother we were done with our homework, and rush out into the park to play. Other kids would be there. In this park I made my first friends. As I grew older I stopped going to the park, except once in a while to jog, or to catch a breath after an argument at home. The other kids hand grown up too. The young families were old families now. The park lay quiet. In recent years, many of those old families moved out, cashing in on their property to settle in condominiums elsewhere. New new families moved in, and the park is alive again, which always brings a smile to my face. I welcome the new generation. The park itself may not be there for long. If the upcoming Cross Island Line takes the alternative route skirting the Central Catchment Area, it'll run right under the neighbourhood. What are the chances the park won't be dug up? Even if is only partly given over to tunneling works, its character will change irrevocably, and with it that of the neighbourhood. This park isn't a national heritage landmark.

Their primary objective was to secure a second beachhead after their successful assault at the Beach on 8 February, in order to breach the defence line as part of their southward thrust towards the heart of the City. Defending the shoreline between the River and the Causeway was the Australian 27th Brigade, led by Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, and one irregular company. On 10 February the Japanese forces suffered their heaviest losses while moving up the River, which caused them to panic and nearly aborted the operation. However, a series of miscommunications and withdrawals by Allied forces in the ensuing battles allowed the Japanese to swiftly gain strategic footholds, which eventually led to the fall of Island on 15 February 1942.    The terrain around here was primarily mangrove swamps and tropical forest intersected by streams and inlets. The shoreline between the River and the Causeway, nearly four kilometers long, was defended by theAustralian 27th Brigade, led by Australian Brigadier Duncan Maxwell. The 27th Infantry Brigade consisted of three battalions\u2014the 2\/30th, 2\/29th, and 2\/26th and was supported by the 2\/10th Field Artillery Regiment, as well as one platoon from the 2\/4th Machine Gun Battalion.   They were supported by one company from Dalforce (named after its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel John Dalley of theMalayan Police Special Branch), a local Chinese militia consisting of Communists, Nationalist supporters, and other volunteers. As the war intensified, the Dalforce volunteers were given only three to four days of training and sent to the war front with elementary weapons. Lacking uniforms, the volunteers improvised by wearing a red triangle on their blue shirts to avoid being mistaken for Japanese by the Australians.   The Allied forces here were assaulted by the Imperial Guards Division led by Major General Takuma Nishimura. 400 Imperial Guards had landed and taken Pulau Ubin, an island in the north-east of the island, in a feint attack on 7 February, where they encountered minimal resistance.

Wang Kang was a high-ranking official of the kingdom of Shu Han - one of the three kingdoms in Chinese history. Being an upright and honest official, he was deeply respected by the people. He was given the title of An Ji Shen Wang (Ang Chee Sia Ong) after his death and a temple was built to honour him. Green snakes were often spotted at the temple and when the people of Chao Shan saw one at the battlefield, they would invariably emerge victorious. They believed that the green snake was the transformation of Ang Chee Sia Ong, whose spirit provided a protection of them against disasters. Hence Ang Chee Sia Ong was also known as Sacred Lord Green Dragon (Qing Long Shen Wang) and the temple, Qing Long Gu Miao.  The Singapore temple was built in 1920s, when Mr Wang Dong Qing brought the deity from Chaozhou Guangdong Province to Singapore on a migration. In the beginning the temple was located at Tao Yuan village and villagers there prayed once a year on the fifth day of the fifth month on the lunar calendar, which was the birthday of Lord Qing Long.  Due to Singapore's being ever hungry for more land, the area around the temple was subject to land reclamation. Hence, the temple was moved to the current location in 1990's.","hint":"across the water from the dragons, under the bridge.","total_found":"108","total_did_not_find":"7"},{"id":8822488,"code":"GC9ZYAA","name":"RAMS - Exit 20A Adam Road","geocacheType":2,"containerType":8,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.3311,"longitude":103.8184833333,"ownerId":"PR140FYZ","ownerName":"Ponpon1961","placedDate":"2022-09-17","lastFoundDate":"2023-04-03","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9ZYAA","description":"The Coast-to-Coast Trail (Central) is a 36 km trail that spans across Singapore, linking up nature areas, parks and park connectors from Jurong Lake Gardens in the west, the new Lornie Nature Corridor near the centre, and to Coney Island Park in the northeast.

And this project is a novel and major one during that time for Malaya and Singapura. The proposed Causeway would be 1.05 km-long and 18.28m-wide, with metre-gauge railway tracks and a 7.92m-wide roadway. It would also include a lock channel that allowed the passage of small vessels, an electric lift-bridge, water pipelines and floodgates to manage the water flow of the straits. The total cost of the project was estimated at $17 million Straits dollars, and was shared among the FMS, Johor and Singapore governments. Officially completed on 11 June 1924, the Causeway\u2019s construction had involved more than 2,000 workers, local and European, over nearly five years and used around 1.14 million m3 of stone. The Causeway completed Singapore\u2019s rail connection to the mainland, and enabled the rapid rise of motor transportation between Singapore and Malaya.   During the Japanese invasion of Malaya, retreating British troops set off two explosions on the Causeway on 31 January 1942. The first wrecked the lock\u2019s lift-bridge, while the second caused a 21.33m gap in the Causeway. The pipelines carrying water to Singapore were also severed. The Japanese subsequently constructed a girder bridge over the gap before taking control of Singapore. After Singapore\u2019s separation from Malaysia in August 1965, the Causeway became the border connector between the two countries. Immigration checkpoints were built on both sides, with passport controls implemented on the Singaporean side from June 1967 and from September on the Malaysian side. Through these years, there are many plans and proposals of replacing the old causeway with a new bridge and has resulted in a political rift between the two countries since the early 2000s. Even right now there is still a silent tension over the straits of Johor which continue to bond and mould our relationship with Malaysia and we hope to be in a positive way.  \r This cache will allow you to experience the daily livelihood of people who need to travel to and fro Singapore - Johor by modes other than car and train, in attempt to exercise or escape the long grueling jams. As frequent JB goers, we have made this crossing several times. Please be prepared for some walking! Or any other ways you can think of.. :) :)\r *extracted from Wikipedia :P  Note that you need to cross the border if you want to get the cache, meaning if you depart from Singapore, please clear immigration at Malaysia, vice versa. And try not to immediately try to cross the border again, maybe have a nice drink or meal on either side before coming back again! : This will save you a lot of questioning. :)\r Also, please refrain from taking photo of the surroundings. You can take photo of the logsheet, but not of the buildings and structures. :P Have fun!","hint":"magnetic. below a box. no need to jump over barrier.","total_found":"112","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":5091789,"code":"GC5YP76","name":"Anglers @ Sea III","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.0,"terrain":1.0,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":1,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.4528,"longitude":103.7785,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2015-07-04","lastFoundDate":"2022-12-04","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC5YP76","description":"Enjoy the scenery.

Located right on the edge of the Straits of Johor, this coastal park boasts unobstructed views of Johor Bahru and a 400M-long jetty. But do you know, there is quite a bit of history behind this waterfront? Singapore Naval Base, also known as \"Her Majesty's Naval Base, Singapore\", \"Sembawang Naval Base\" and \"HMS Sembawang\", was built by the British government during the 1920s and 30s and stretches throughout today's Woodlands and Sembawang.The base was occupied by Japanese forces during World War II but reverted to British control in 1945 when Japan surrendered. Parts of this waterfront base at Woodlands would later serve as the main base of the Royal Malaysian Navy as \"KD Malaya\". Today, this site has been transformed into Woodlands Waterfront Park, a coastal promenade and park in the northern part of Singapore. Let us go on a trip to see the various remnants along the waterfront!   Things to note:  The total length of this multi-cache is around 3.9 km. Feel free to bring a bike, but you will need to leave it for one of the waypoints Wear covered shoes, get mosquito repellant and bring along a flashlight. We need to enter the forest a bit for one of the waypoints and it can get pretty muddy. You may want to solve GC9G3J1 before going for this multi-cache since the GZ is along the way. If you want to go for GC1M86T as well, please be prepared for it.     WP1: Former View Road Hospital N 01\u00b0 27.105 E 103\u00b0 47.391  We start at the former mental hospital at View Road claimed to be haunted. This building dates back to 1941 and was built to be an admin building\/command centre for the British Royal Army, known back then as the Rimau Offices and Accommodations. After the fall of Singapore, the Japanese occupied and completed the construction of the compound. It was returned to the British after the war and left unoccupied. In 1959, the compound was converted into Rimau Naval Base Police Barracks, housing asians like Sikhs and Gurkhas. It provided lodging for the police force working in Singapore Naval Base and was vacated once again in 1971 when the British withdrew from Singapore. The compound stay unoccupied till 1975 when it was converted into a hospital to alleviate the overcrowding situation at Woodbridge Hospital, eventually closing down in 2001. The compound briefly served as a foreign worker dormitory as View Road Lodge from 2008 to 2011 before being returned to the state and is currently unoccupied once more.    You will find a tube sticking out of the ground at the coordinates, let A be the two-digit number behind the red rectangle. Unfortunately, due to cameras and motion sensors one can't just walk up to the entrance of the building to have a look at it, which is why the waypoint is at the road entrance. No spooky ghosts for you. On a side note, the bus stop near this waypoint has weird dilapidated stairs at the back that lead to nowhere. Pretty neat and kinda spooky.    WP2: The Two Prisons N 01\u00b0 27.074 E 103\u00b0 46.967  This waypoint brings you to the gate of the closed Khalsa Crescent Prison, used to be known as Khalsa Crescent Drug Rehabilitation Centre. These buildings were originally an Asian naval staff dormitory built by the British in the 1950s and were converted into a drug rehabilitation center in 1973. Eventually it was closed down and the inmates were moved to Changi Prison in 2009. Take a nice long look at the abandoned watchtower, not everyday you can come across these.    Look at the two radio cabinets at the right side of the gate. Let B be the four-digit number behind the red rectangle.\r (the number is the same for both cabinets)    Across the road, you will see a site being developed. This site used to be the admin building and barracks of KD (Kapal Di-Raja) Malaya, the main base of the Royal Malaysian Navy until 1979, and then served as a training facility until 1997 when Singapore increased the rent. It was eventually converted into Admiralty West Prison till it was closed down in 2018, with the prison's functions relocated to Tanah Merah. Today, a lone building within the former prison site still stands, its surrounding buildings demolished. That building, the administrative block of the former naval base, will be kept as part of a future housing development at the site.    WP3: Former Royal Malaysian Navy Jetty N 01\u00b0 27.325 E 103\u00b0 46.744  Located within the restricted compounds of the former naval base, the Royal Malaysian Navy Jetty was used regularly by the RMN for events such as commissioning of new ships. When the RMN returns to Johor in 1981, the jetty was left unused until 1997 when Malaysia agreed to transfer the properties to Singapore. Today, the jetty has been incorporated as part of the Woodlands Waterfront redevelopment and is now opened to the public, becoming a popular spot for anglers and joggers. Don't forget to pick up GC5YP76, if you haven't done it.    There are two camera stations at the end of the jetty. Look closely at the large bolts on them and let C be the two-digit number behind the red rectangle.    WP4: Marsiling Bunker N 01\u00b0 27.012 E 103\u00b0 46.418  Not as notorious as the infamous Marsiling Tunnel, the nearby Marsiling Bunker is still pretty neat and worth a visit, and those who approached the Marsiling Tunnel from the south would probably have missed this one. Unlike the Marsiling Tunnel, the Bunker is not muddy and much smaller, making it much safer to explore alone and without any special equipment. The forest trail there is pretty muddy though, watch out! To get there, go to the coordinates of this waypoint and look for lamppost 1R23, then just follow the well-established trail. When you reach a fork, go uphill, and when you see climbing ropes you are on the right track. Can't miss the entrance, really.    Look for a white paint bucket within the bunker. Let D be the five-digit number behind the red rectangle. \r Yes I am using actual garbage for the waypoint. Not much I can use inside and I can't leave something physical since it is too close to the Marsiling Tunnel cache. I have seen this bucket in videos of this place dating 2 years back though, but if it's gone just inform me and I will try to come up with something (as a last resort I can always have the cacher measure stuff inside the bunker with a tape measure). For extra fun, try exiting the Bunker via the 2 smaller passages.    WP5: Rotherham Gate N 01\u00b0 26.918 E 103\u00b0 46.280  During the days of Singapore Naval Base, this spot was the location of the Rotherham Gate, one of the main entrances into the base. It was named after the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Rotherham. When you are there, look closely at the big tree and you will notice a rectangular stone block within the vegetation. That is one of the gate posts of Rotherham Gate, and all that is left of it today.    You will find an electric box at the coordinates, let E be the three-digit number behind the red rectangle. This is also the end\/beginning of the Pipeline Trail. Completers of the Pipeline Odyssey, rejoice!    WP6: Shell Lubricant Blending Plant N 01\u00b0 26.895 E 103\u00b0 46.318  The Shell Lubricant Blending Plant here was built in 1963, and after operations were shifted over to a larger facility at Tuas in 2017 this facility was closed down. It doesn't really have anything connected to military stuff like the other waypoints, but this building is yet another abandoned building here and one of the remnants of old Woodlands. There is also an abandoned school south of here that I have a cache at, along with the closed mall and cinema along Woodlands Centre Road... What's with the number of abandoned buildings around here? Anyway, the old-fashioned electronics at the gate of this lubricant blending plant are pretty fun to examine.    You will find a fire hydrant at the coordinates, let F be the two-digit number behind the red rectangle.    The Cache N 01\u00b0 26.XXX E 103\u00b0 46.YYY To get XXX, add 154 to the first 3 digits of (A*B*C*D*E*F). To get YYY, substract 513 from the next 3 digits of (A*B*C*D*E*F). The hint for the cache location is within the geochecker:   Oh how I wish I can enter some of these abandoned buildings to take a look around. There are quite a few remnants of Singapore Naval Base at Sembawang's side as well, perhaps I will place a multi-cache there as well. If there is any problem with any of the waypoints please inform me.

Much has been written about it and there are some references at the end of these notes that are definitely worth a read. For me, Bukit Brown is simply a lovely place to walk and relax and I walk there several times a week. There are the obvious walks along the main roads but the real delights are taking the old paths through the forested areas to find treasures from the past. I have always been excited to find examples of old, fired, red clay bricks that were used to construct the headstones and surrounds of the graves. The traditional, older bricks are marked inside the \"frog\" (the indented part of the brick) with the name of the Singapore kiln company that made the brick (for example, Alexandra, Jurong, Goh Bee). Heaped up or isolated, these bricks will have formed some sort of structure and most likely some part of a grave - please be respectful and leave them where you see them. The cache itself is a small glass bottle hidden behind something that is itself natural but shaped by man's hand. The \"something\" is in an unexpected place - hence \"How did that get there?\". You might need to take some tweezers to get to the paper in the bottle. Once you find it, ponder briefy how long it must have taken to get to where it is - 20 years? Longer? We will never know. When re-hiding the cache, please make sure the whole bottle is hidden from view.

Not that I have any particular obsession with parks and playgrounds, but aside from geocaching, it's just another excuse to go walking in Singapore, giving a bit of structure to my meanderings. While I'm at it, may as well hide some caches as well! At least at those playgrounds convenient enough for me to do maintenance on, since I don't drive. Decided that for the first cache in this casual \"series\", I may as well pop by the playground at Taman Permata estate, since this is relatively close to where I live. I used to pass by this place many times as a kid, but to be honest it wasn't the playground I remember most, but Lake View Shopping Centre instead.

The shopfronts could do with some investment in glass frontages rather than steel rolling doors, and the whole area needs a makeover of parking management. Just installing bollard and barriers to prevent encroachment of car parking would work perfectly and is something many cities have done to prevent parking on walkways in historical areas. The nearby Jalan Dhoby shows the way. The walkway has been widened and rebuilt in early 2020, with attractive landscaping and fences and kerbs making it impossible for cars to park there. Widening the walkways meant narrowing the roadway and removing most of the on-street parking, making it less attractive for driving around and encouraging people to walk there instead, which is how it should be. Responding to the improved street conditions, shops have been upgraded and the street is lined with newly renovated restaurants and cafes which often look out upon the street and serve to further 'activate' the street and make it an even more appealing. It's an impressive transformation compared to just a year ago when the street consisted of closed or run-down shops, narrow walkways and a continuous row of angle-parked vehicles.","hint":"magnetic","total_found":"31","total_did_not_find":"3"},{"id":8444377,"code":"GC9J7W6","name":"RAMS Empress Road","geocacheType":2,"containerType":8,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.3163166667,"longitude":103.80495,"ownerId":"PR140FYZ","ownerName":"Ponpon1961","placedDate":"2021-11-09","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-05","lastFoundTime":"16:44:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9J7W6","description":"Farrer Road is located in the Bukit Timah HDB Estate.

Updating the new look of this Hot Spring and the amenities that you can find here.  Brand new sign to welcome you at the entrance. Follow the path and be greeted by the florals and even a small eatery just a few steps away from the Hot Spring pool.  A nice place to have some food and drinks or get away from the blazing sun or wet weather if you are caught in it.  In place of the old hot spring tap and pipes (which you can find in the old post below), the new one boast a 12 pax footbath! (depending how many pax you want to squeeze on the stone bench that is XD). Hot Spring temperature various from Hot to Mega HOT. So please be careful when fetching the scorching spring water or dipping your feet into it. Take note to only dip your feet at the designated area to keep it hygienic for everyone.   Take care to not soak your feet for extended amount of time as the steam and heat may cause dizzyness especially for people with medical or health conditions.    There is also now an egg boiling section. BYOP (bring your own pail!) and Eggs. For best results, place your pail full of eggs under constant running tap outlet for 10mins or more (depending how well done you would like your eggs to be).

Instructions are in the the original post below and all the answers can still be found at the new premise. Have fun! ------------------------------ <ORIGINAL CACHE POST> Sembawang Hot Spring also known as \"Kampong Ayer Panas (Hot Water Village)\" is the only natural hot spring on the mainland of Singapore and one of the very few geographical phenomenon we have in Singapore. \r Many people once come to this premise in seek of cures for skin problems, rheumatism and arthritis. As much as 1000 people visited this spring at weekends during its peak. However, this have now become a quiet sanctuary for people who still remembered its existence. \r Being a preserved site, Sembwang Hot Spring had undergone many renovations. Now, terrain at GZ is flat and properly pathed through a wooded area. You will see a concreted open area once you reach GZ. \r Hot springs are springs of water with temperature higher than in the surroundings. It emerge from underground and remains hot with steam emanating from it. \r Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with magma or hot rock masses. Since Singapore is not in any volcanic regions, formation of Sembawang Hot Spring is most probably due to hot rock masses. The hot rocks heats up the water and forces it up through cracks in the ground. Minerals and salts dissolves and get added to the spring water as it make its way up. \r Temperature of the hot spring is very high which thus lets off steam when water comes out on the surface. The steaming effect is a significant aspect of a hot spring. Due to the high temperature, spring water is a also better solvent and allows more minerals and salts to be dissolved in it. \r Sembawang Hot Spring's water can reach a temperature of 131\u00b0C or 270 \u00b0F underground running out at a yield of 150 litres per minute. Do becareful while handling spring water as it is boiling hot and can scald. Do pay close attention if you are bringing kids along to this place. \r The exact source of Sembawang Hot Spring is still unknown, however it is believed that its origin maybe southwest of its location, possibly at Bukit Timah. \r Singapore sits on the stable Asian continental plate Sundaland. It composed mainly of Granite and minor Gabbro, intruded into a km thick blanket of contemporary acid volcanics and partly covered by Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic sediments. Sembawang Hot Spring lies over a Granite bedrock which stretches from north to central Singapore including Bukit Timah Hill. \r Usually, granite bedrock is not permeable for hot springs to occur unless it is well fractured. Studies on stress vectors in Sumatra section of Australian Plate collision in the Sumatra-Java trench, subduction zone to the SW of Singapore and present day stress maps suggests that horizontal stress is orientated NE\/SW in neighbouring Sumatra. \r Coupled with measurements from joints and faults orientation of granite and gabbro quarries of Singapore, it suggest that the strong NE\/SW orientation of open joints sets will preferentially channel ground water in a NE\/SW direction (Sembawang) from its watersheds (Bukit Timah Hill) which thus gave rise to Sembawang Hot Spring.   \r Buses available to this area are 167, 856, 858, 859, 969 or 980. If you are driving, you can always park at the nearby HBD carparks. Opening hours are from 7am - 7pm daily. Entrance is free. \r Do bring along a tower and a small pail to collect spring water. You might want to bring a small stool as well though there are some plastic chairs around for use. \r References: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sembawang_Hot_Spring\r http:\/\/nus.academia.edu\/GrahameOliver\/Papers\/155717\/Geothermal_Energy_Concept_for_Singapore \r To log this Earthcache, please email me your answers to the following questions: \r 1.

The area comprises around forty colonial bungalows and is one of many sites scattered around Singapore where you can find a rich history of our colonial past. I used to walk through this relatively hidden stretch of road after tuition classes at The Learning Lab at Rochester Mall, which is located conveniently next to a beautiful Starbucks. Back then, I only wanted to get home as soon as possible as it was pretty dang creepy at night, especially for a primary school girl who is walking alone. Now that I'm back, though, it's a trip down memory lane and also a good place to really think about how these old houses (though renovated), are related to Singapore's history.     The cache is near a small window of space where you get close to the moving trains. You can either just watch the train pass by and enjoy the sounds of a Singaporean night, be it the rumbling of the MRT trains, crickets chirping in the background or the sound of water trickling by the interesting fountain-isque structure near 23 @ Rochester Park, a pretty modern office building. There is also an interesting information board nearby detailing the significance and thoughts that went into building these colonial houses\u2013 I will spare you the explanation as it'll just be cut-and-paste from the board itself. Come read it for yourself, I promise it's pretty interesting!  There's also tables and chairs around for you to rest up as well.

I have covered the colourful history in my cache by the \u201cAng Mo\u2019s Bridge\u201d, where we looked at some of the theories \u2013 ranging from Thomson\u2019s Bridge to a haunting by a lady of Windsor Park. There were also a couple of other theories I briefly mentioned, and one of them was quite\u2026 fruity. So, according to the vegetable\u2026 err\u2026 fruit(?) story, Ang Mo Kio gets its name from the Hokkien word for \u201cTomato\u201d, since \u201cKio\u201d is a \u201cbrinjal or eggplant\u201d and \u201cAng\u201d means \u201cred\u201d. Proponents of these etymology say that it stems from Ang Mo Kio\u2019s past as a plantation, where rubber and other vegetables were planted in a valley near the Kallang River\u2026 but detractors say that there was no record of tomatoes being planted in the area, so\u2026 go figures. My recent research also uncovered yet another theory for the origin of the name, and this one is too funny to not share. In this version, the \u201cAng Mo\u201d is, once again, the \u201cAng Moh\u201d (Caucasian man), while the \u201cKio\u201d is said to be a corruption of \u201cKia\u201d, which means \u201cscared\u201d in Hokkien (as in \u201cKia-su\u201d or \u201cKia-si\u201d, which are \u201cscared to lose\u201d and \u201cscared to die\u201d, respectively). So, the story goes that our illustrious John Turnbull Thomson (who, you\u2019ll recall, was the \u201cAng Mo\u201d after which the bridge got its name in our very first theory) was surveying the region in the early 19th century, when a tiger attacked his party and gave him a nasty fright. The rest, I suppose, is history, though I imagine that he wouldn\u2019t be too pleased with his tigrine tryst becoming the origin of the placename.   The most interesting thing about this particular anecdote is that there actually is a painting of the alleged incident with our main man Thomson in it. The painting is by a German artist, Heinrich Leutemann, is titled Unterbrochene Strassenmessung auf Singapore which translates to Road Surveying Interrupted in Singapore. I prefer to call it \u201cThe Tiger and the Theodolite\u201d, as this article does. The painting shows Thomson (the only \u201cAng Mo\u201d in the picture, obviously) recoiling in fright as a tiger emerges from the woods and topples the theodolite (a device used for measuring angles in land surveys). Now, whether this incident really happened and if this was really how Ang Mo Kio got its name may never be definitively proven, but I hope it\u2019s another interesting piece of local trivia and heritage that you might not have known about.   Whichever theory you think is most plausible, that\u2019s for you to mull over as you look for this cache.  The Cache At the published coordinates, you will find a sculpture that is donated by a company associated with a red fruit. To find the final cache, you will need to solve the following simple maths problem based on the plaque describing the sculpture. Consider the quadratic equation:  \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\) where a = the total number of words on the plaque, b = the number of times the word \"red\" appears in the text, and c = the number of times the word \"tomato\" appears in the text.  Solve for x, and let the two solutions to the equation be \u03b1 and \u03b2 where \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b2  The cache is located a distance of \u03b1 metres from the published coordinates, at a bearing of \u03b2 degrees. Head over to your projected final coordinates, and you'll find the final cache there. Good luck and happy hunting!

The building formerly housed the Chief Minister's office and the Johor State Legislative Assembly before both were moved to Kota Iskandar. There are plans to turn the building into a museum. Sultan Ibrahim was the 2nd Sultan of modern Johor and lived through the tumultuous times of British colonial rule, Japanese occupation, and then independence, spending much of his time in Europe. His mixed legacy is summarized in Wikipedia: \"In recent years, efforts have been made by the sultan's heirs to rehabilitate his image and paint him as a benevolent ruler. However his skeptics do not agree and set the Late Sultan Ibrahim as a ruler that is largely remembered as an anti-independence figure, a wastrel and a close (almost deferential) ally of the British. Even with that view, he is viewed as the man whom continued his father's legacy of investing in pepper, gambier and rubber, which largely improved the economic situation of Johor.\" The GPS won't be much help with this cache.

Change happens so slowly you don\u2019t notice it while it\u2019s happening, and any changes that happened before your lifetime may as well be fairy tales. While doing a bit of research into the history of my neighbourhood and its environs, I stumbled upon a blog post talking about how a section of Upper Thomson Road had been realigned. As you can see in the maps below, from the 1984 and 1988 editions of the Singapore Street Map, Upper Thomson Road used to run tightly against Westlake Avenue, but straightened out with the construction of MacRitchie Viaduct, running parallel to it instead. Singapore Street Maps, 1984 (left) and 1988 (right):  I don\u2019t know that anyone would consider this an earth-shattering change. Perhaps those who lived in Westlake Gardens estate, immediately adjacent to the realignment, might have found the character of the place changed a little bit. Nevertheless, I\u2019d been fascinated recently by changes in our urban landscape and the invisible traces they leave behind, so I decided to take a look myself, and to make a multi-cache out of it. This multi-cache will take you to six locations, including the GZ, and should take less than half an hour to do. It isn\u2019t the most scenic or exciting multi-cache, but I hope that, like me, you\u2019ll find something interesting in the ordinary. Waypoint #1 - MacRitchie Viaduct (N 1\u00b0 20.536, E 103\u00b0 50.1682) First stop: the cause of the realignment. MacRitchie Viaduct was constructed at a cost of $22 million, and took 20 months to complete, opening to the public on 27 Feb 1988. Spanning 800 metres, the viaduct linked Lornie Road to Upper Thomson Road, and was planed to ease traffic flow in the area. GPS might be off. Climb the stairs and look for 504A4   Waypoint #2 - Remnants of the old alignment (N 1\u00b0 20.6845, E 103\u00b0 50.2812) Standing in this triangular field, imagine for a moment the traffic whooshing right on top of you, as they turned the corner around Westlake Gardens estate, heading north up Upper Thomson Road. Look for 2054B Waypoint #3 - St. Theresa\u2019s Home (N 1\u00b0 20.77, E 103\u00b0 50.2772) Follow the road up to the gates of St. Theresa\u2019s Home for the Aged, first established in 1935 by the Little Sisters of the Poor, and initially named after the French Catholic religious institute. The foundation stone for the current building complex was laid slightly afterwards, in 1937, by Sir Thomas Shenton, then Governor of the Straits Settlements. Catholic Welfare Services Singapore took over management of the Home on 1 July 2003. C = Number of lines of Chinese on this gate   Waypoint #4 - Kampong San Teng Community Centre (N 1\u00b0 20.7583 E 103\u00b0 50.3308) If you take a look again at the 1984 street map, you\u2019ll notice that a road used to run from Upper Thomson Road, cutting across Marymount Road, into Kampong San Teng. As a child growing up in the 90s and going to school in Bishan, I was keenly aware of the fact that Bishan estate stood on the site of what used to be a massive Cantonese and Hakka cemetery. I wonder if kids going to school today feel the fact quite so acutely.  The road into Kampong San Teng continues to appear in the 1988 street map, albeit no longer from Upper Thomson Road, only vanishing in the 1998 edition. Also featuring on the 1984 map is Kampong San Teng Community Centre which, to gauge from the 1984 and 1988 street maps, used to sit roughly where this waypoint is, at the eastern entrance to the pedestrian underpass crossing under Upper Thomson Road, built at the same time as MacRitchie Viaduct. GPS might be slightly off. Check that your hair and teeth are ok and look for 515D1  Waypoint #5 - Marymount Road (N 1\u00b0 20.6492, E 103\u00b0 50.3297) The fifth and final waypoint lies a short distance up Marymount Road, constructed some time before MacRitchie Viaduct, in 1979. The road was opened in two phases, the first in July 1979, running from Thomson Road near Marymount Convent to where Marymount Station is today, and the second in August 1979, running the rest of the way to Ang Mo Kio Ave 6.  Like MacRitchie Viaduct, Marymount Road was also constructed to resolve traffic issues, providing drivers heading to and from the city a bypass around heavy traffic on Lornie and Braddell Roads coming up Upper Thomson. It seemed at first that the solution didn\u2019t really work. I\u2019ll leave it to drivers to decide whether it did eventually.

It has weather protection (from the elevated road above), some new landscaping amongst the sea of concrete, and varied views fairly similar to the ones from the elevated walkway. In theory, perhaps pedestrians could be expected to walk this way instead of using an elevated walkway. In fact, however, the elevated walkway experience is more attractive; especially if it happens to be raining. Down below pedestrians need to cross some roads, and generally pay attention as there are various obstacles and points where the walkway narrows. Up above, the unobstructed thoroughfare allows pedestrians to move serenely and obliviously along in a space between the elevated roads to the west, the roads & parking below, and the train station and trucks to either side. Apart from the generous width, excellent weather protection and good lighting, cleaning and maintenance ensured by making the mall develop responsible, a key success factor in this long elevated walkway may have been achieved unintentionally. The need of the elevated walkway to weave around and under a large number of pillars from elevated roads and ramps and pass over the road below results in a walkway which rather than being direct, has slight deviations. Consequently sight lines are continually refreshed, and the experience is more appealing than just walking along an arrow-straight walkway would have been.","hint":"go with the flow","total_found":"23","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":7675914,"code":"GC8QE72","name":"I \u2764 Johor Bahru","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":2.0,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.460433,"longitude":103.769033,"ownerId":"PRVH5WB","ownerName":"michael_gz","placedDate":"2020-05-13","lastFoundDate":"2023-04-07","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC8QE72","description":"Tanjung Puteri is a diverse cluster of older apartment buildings, commercial buildings with shops at ground level, restaurants, hotels, and trading-related businesses linked to the nearby CIQ complex.

An international smuggling ring may have brought in a dangerous quantity of phosphorus triiodide into the country and hidden the vial in an unknown location. The compound is stable, but will react vigorously with water to form a strong acid. Our fear is that once this drought ends, rain water may begin seeping into their storage facility and cause the compound to react at an exponential rate to form phosphoric acid.

All the information can be found online, if you know where to look. However, if you wish to go into the \u201cfield\u201d to find the answers, no one is going to stop you, of course.  Scattered around Singapore\u2019s HDB estates are little bits of heritage, some more well-known than others. Search and discover the following numbers to reveal the coordinates for the next stage. . Singapore\u2019s national flower was serendipitously discovered in the garden of a lady whose name the flower now bears. The sites of her house and her garden are now long gone and replaced with a cluster of HDB flats. However, a \u201creplacement\u201d garden has been set up in its place next to a block of those flats and planted with that very same flower. The block number of the HDB block nearest to that garden is the value of A. The HDB (Housing and Development Board) was formed in 1960 in place of the SIT (Singapore Improvement Trust) with the task of providing public housing. One of its earliest projects was to build a cluster of flats in an area named for the place trains once stop to wait for the signal to indicate that the tracks were clear. The number of storeys that these flats have is BC. Some may consider the shape of these flats lucky, but for the HDB, the design and construction of this landmark block of flats marked a bold experiment in architecture (and for the residents, a challenge in furniture design). With commanding views of the Central Catchment Area, this 24-storey block stands tall both in actual height and in Singapore history.  The sum of the digits of this block\u2019s number is DE. There are many HDB New Towns in Singapore, but this tiny town with a huge identity stands out from the rest. Many of its blocks are built with unconventional long slanted \u201cslide roofs\u201d, which may or may not have contributed to the town\u2019s rather maverick inclinations. The sum of the digits of the town\u2019s most \u201cwelcoming\u201d block is F. Located in the downtown area, many would recognise the flamboyant quartet of HDB flats that has defined the area\u2019s identity for years. Soon to be demolished to make way for a new expressway, the bright colours of the four blocks will soon only be a memory. The block number of the blue block is G. In Singapore\u2019s east, there a town that some have argued takes its name from a group of very beautiful ladies from Chinese history. The streets in this town were initially named after the ladies\u2019 names, but after complaints that non-Chinese residents were finding it hard to pronounce the street names, HDB reverted to just numbering the streets. The number of the street that was previously named after the lady pictured below is H. [Additional note for H: there is an old newspaper image with a map that shows the old names of the roads. Use that source to find H] . Stage 2: Art at the Very Heart This stage is definitely a field puzzle! Don\u2019t worry, the final is close by.  This stage is located at: North 01 19. (H + E \u2013 D) (A + B + C) (F \u2013 B) East 103 50. (F + G  + C) (H \u2013 D \u2013 B) (B + D)       When you arrive at the coordinates, you should see a very prominent sculpture outside the building. The last digit of the year the metal sculpture was commissioned is I. Step into the nearby building and inside, you should spot a long piece of collaborative art. Search for the values hidden behind the box in the photo below.   \r .                       Stage 3 (Final): Rising Higher   The final is located at these coordinates: North 01 19. (J + K) (F - G) (H + I) East 103 50. (A + C + G) (B + K) (D + E)       The cache is located higher than the highest point of the nearby sculpture.

The city was founded in 1855 by Wong Ah Fook, a Chinese businessmen who arrived in Singapore in 1854, and Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim. In 2013 Jl. Wong Ah Fook was the main point where city buses gathered, and lingered, waiting for outbound passengers, leading to huge queues of buses and significant congestion. In recent years buses have been completely banned from operating in the street, which has improved car flow but practically eliminated transit access to the downtown and created a nightmare for pedestrians trying to cross the road. The Segget River that passes down it has been opened up and lined with landscaping improvements opening later in 2021. Unfortunately there is only one signalized, safe pedestrian crossing along the entire 1km downtown street of Jalan Wong Ah Fook, which combined with the high traffic flows means the street effectively severs the east and west sides of the CBD, making it quite difficult for people arriving at the CIQ complex to go beyond the two malls; a situation which suits the two malls just fine. The northern part of the street, where the cache is located, is dominated by the Komtar and JB City Square malls, the older and more popular of which (JB City Square) features landscaping on the Jl. Wong Ah Fook side that by accident or design provides some welcome seating for passers-by to take a break from the heat and watch the traffic and pedestrians pass by. JB City Square includes a rooftop seating and viewing area with excellent views down Jl. Wong Ah Fook in both directions.","hint":"10cm","total_found":"37","total_did_not_find":"2"},{"id":9047906,"code":"GCA7FWW","name":"The Royal Observatory?","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":2.0,"terrain":2.0,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":2,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.370986,"longitude":103.847947,"ownerId":"PR6064Y","ownerName":"ZacharyKZH","placedDate":"2023-04-18","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-19","lastFoundTime":"20:29:57","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GCA7FWW","description":"As far as HDB estates go, most of them are nondescript places which we visit more out of necessity rather than a tourist attraction. However, some blocks are a little more\u2026 special. This cache brings you to one of two blocks that were built specifically to be \u201cattractions\u201d!   Block 710 in Ang Mo Kio Central does seem like your typical point block: tall, narrow and filled with HDB flats, but look closely, and you\u2019ll notice that its rooftop isn\u2019t quite like the others. There is a sheltered observatory that offers any visitor an unhindered 360-degree view of Ang Mo Kio and the surrounding region, which I am sure is quite the sight to behold\u2026 if only it were open to the public. Sadly, the area is locked and inaccessible, so please don\u2019t bother the residents by poking about the top floor.   But why does this block exist? Block 710 is one of two so-called \u201cVIP Blocks\u201d, which were purpose-built to serve as both a typical residential block and, more importantly, a stopover point for foreign dignitaries. The other \u201cVIP Block\u201d is the unique Y-shaped Block 53, Lorong 5 Toa Payoh. The Singapore government, in its early days, was rightfully proud of its New Town building programmes, with its neatly organised HDB Flats and bustling central hubs. So, official state visits by foreign leaders were sure to include at least one trip to such estates, mainly so that the government could show off their latest town construction projects.   In fact, on the late Queen Elizabeth\u2019s first two state visits to Singapore in 1972 and 1989, she was brought to Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio respectively, and guess which blocks she was brought to visit\u2026 yup, that right: Block 53 and Block 710.   Unfortunately, we mere mortal geocachers are not so privileged, so we\u2019ll have to make do with the view from the neighbouring commercial Block 710A. You may need to get a little higher for a better look of the surroundings (read: go up to the second floor), though, frankly, the scenery isn\u2019t enhanced much\u2026 but you might just find a geocache to make it worth the trouble \ud83d\ude09 Happy hunting!

Whoever understands that everything is kong Rises above all personal suffering and misfortune.\r Buddha Shakyamuni elaborated this wisdom further to his disciple Sariputra: The material world is no different from kong; kong is no different from the material world. The material world is therefore kong, and kong is therefor the material world. Kong is also all sensations, perceptions, decisions, and all awareness. Sariputra, all phenomena and observations are kong. Phenomena such as life and death, filth and cleanliness, gain and loss Are all kong. Since kong is everything, there can be no material world and no sensations, perceptions, decisions or awareness from the viewpoint of a separate self, no separate eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind, no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or any other phenomena, no individual view point, no individual field of consciousness, no delusion of separation, and no ending of delusion of separation, no aging and death, and no ending of aging and death. The four phases of cultivation no longer exist- No experiencing the suffering in life\u2026 No discovering the cause of suffering\u2026 No cultivation to eliminate suffering\u2026and No reaching the ultimate state of no separate self and an end to suffering. This principle makes no one wiser, since there is no separate self; No individual gains anything, since there is nothing separate to be gained. People receive enlightenment because they follow this perfect wisdom. They have wide-open hearts without worries And, therefore, none of the worries of a separate self. They also have no fear. All delusions and self-centered fantasies are far removed. Enlightened ones reach ultimate nirvana. Three generations of Buddha Have followed this ultimate wisdom And attained the highest perfect enlightenment. Therefore, come to know this ultimate wisdom in a grand spiritual mantra, A great enlightenment mantra, A supreme mantra, A mantra with no peers that is able to end all suffering.

You need their official names (and not their nicknames or their Hanyu Pinyin-ised names) Once the list is complete you can determine the final coordinates.

A friend who recently returned from Tibet he bought it from a street peddler. What was odd was that the peddler quickly recommended this particular wheel when my friend said he was from Singapore.\u201d \u201cLet me have a look\u201d, Amos replied. \u201cHmm\u2026 it is odd. You know, the inscriptions on these wheels are usually a mantra of some sort. Like \u2018Om Mani Padme Hum\u2019 or something. They believe that spinning the wheel is equivalent to chanting the mantra repeatedly. Each spin represents a single chant of the mantra.\u201d \u201cOoh, very nice. What is written on this one?\u201d I asked curiously as he spun the discs that made up the wheel. \u201cYou\u2019re right to say it\u2019s not a typical wheel. Each of the eight discs is simply inscribed with a string of numbers written in Sanskrit. This is not a prayer, as I would expect\u2026 Hmm\u2026 what\u2019s this? There\u2019s something inscribed at the top face of the top disc. It reads\u2026 \u2018Action\u2019 in Sanskrit\u201d \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t know you read Sanskrit!\u201d I said, impressed. Amos replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t get with a Masters in Religious Studies without learning a thing or two in Sanskrit. About the inscription, it sounds like one of the parts of the Noble Eight-fold Path\u201d I chimed in, \u201cMaybe the other discs are labelled the same way.\u201d So, I tinkered with the wheel a little, and the top of the axle holding the discs together came off. I took out each of the eight discs, one by one, and laid them on my work table. \u201cCome over here, Amos, it looks like each of the discs has a unique inscription\u201d \u201cAh, yes, I was right. Each wheel bears the name of a part of the Eight-Fold Path, the path to self-awareness and awakening in Buddhism.\u201d \u201cIt does look like a puzzle of some sort\u2026 Could you translate each disc and its corresponding numbers for me?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou think I very free at work, is it?\u201d he jokingly replied. \u201cOh, OK, I\u2019ll do it for you\u201d. About 15 minutes later, he passed me a piece of paper with the following list:    \r (Important note: the disc is round and the sequence does not seem to start at any particular number, so I just randomly chose one to start.  For example, the sequence of numbers for the first disc (\u201cAction\u201d) could also be |3|4|6|7|5|1|9|2|0|8|, |6|7|5|1|9|2|0|8|3|4| or |7|5|1|9|2|0|8|3|4|6|)\r    \r Action:        |4|6|7|5|1|9|2|0|8|3|\r \r Concentration: |1|3|5|8|2|4|6|0|7|9|\r \r Effort:        |8|4|1|0|6|3|7|9|2|5|\r \r Intention:     |7|3|1|8|4|2|5|6|0|0|\r \r Livelihood:    |2|5|4|6|1|9|7|3|0|8|         \r \r Mindfulness:   |1|9|8|0|4|3|2|5|7|6|\r \r Speech:        |9|4|3|1|6|7|5|8|2|0|\r \r View:          |4|1|0|3|2|7|8|6|9|5|\r     I didn\u2019t know what to do with the numbers, so I returned the wheel to the friend who bought the wheel in Tibet. I mentioned what Amos said to me about the wheel, and he lit up all of a sudden. \u201cAh, so that\u2019s what the peddler meant when he sold me the wheel\u201d he excitedly said. \u201cWhat did the peddler tell you when he sold you the wheel?\u201d I asked, too, with as much enthusiasm. \u201cSomething like, \u201cA secret will be revealed when the Right and Noble Path is followed and all Eight are in alignment\u201d. I did not think much of it, but now that you mention the inscriptions and the numbers\u2026  I think we might be on to something\u201d, he recalled.   So, my fellow cachers: what do you make of this wheel and all of its strange numbers? You can check if you have attained the right path to enlightenment here. PS: Special thanks to my colleague, friend and History teacher, Amos for providing the inspiration for this puzzle.

Malaysian cities in general and Johor Bahru in particular has amongst the highest requirements in the world for minimum parking provision in new developments. An office building in the city centre, for example, is required to provide 2.2 car parking spaces for every 100 square metres of office floor space. This is more than ten times the requirement in Singapore (0.2 spaces per 100 sqm) and contrasts with the best practice in many cities worldwide which is to place a cap on off-street parking provision in new developments in dense downtown areas. In central cities less parking is generally better, with cities worldwide reducing parking provision in order to encourage public transport and more active modes such as walking and cycling. This worldwide trend will likely catch on at some point in JB, but until then large multilevel podiums accounting for nearly a third of the total floor area of new developments are devoted to car parking. The architects often go to quite creative lengths to disguise the facade of the multilevel parking, as for example in the background of the cache area photo. Many of the older buildings, however, such as to the right of the cache area in the photo, put little or no design effort into the parking, which rather deadens the street. On the plus side, the lack of people should make it an easy place to search.","hint":"grassy knoll","total_found":"23","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8327634,"code":"GC9EAC9","name":"DNF Sibling 1","geocacheType":2,"containerType":6,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.345917,"longitude":103.695583,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2021-07-25","lastFoundDate":"2023-01-28","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9EAC9","description":"\u201cDNF\u201d stands for \u201cDid Not Find\u201d in our game.

You will be presented rebus puzzles consisting of a set of images, which when intepreted and read correctly, form a name or a phrase. For instance, the pictures below (taken from Kennst du... diese L\u00e4nder #3) can be read as Madagascar (Mad + a + gas + car):     Simple enough? In this puzzle, I will give you 7 sets of images that represent famous locations around the world, and you need to work out what they are. Do all 7 have something in common, you wonder? The answer: yes, of course! Ready? Here we go: Location 1  Location 2  Location 3  Location 4  Location 5  Location 6  Location 7   The Coordinates Once you are done, you will now need to arrange the 7 locations from North to South. If you need their coordinates, you can go to their pages on Wikipedia and you will find the coordinates conveniently posted on the top right hand corner of the page. Now that you have arranged the locations, label the one furthest North as A,  followed by B, C and so on... and the location furthest South is G The coordinates for the final cache is: N01  19.(B1)(E7)(A1+F4)\r E103 50.(G10)(C19)(D2+G3-B2) B1 simply tells you to substitute the value of the first letter of the location B. For example, if B is \"Merlion\", then B1 = letter M = 13 You can check if you have solved for the coordinates correctly here:   Oh, and one more thing. You can check if you have the right locations using the following method. The German geocachers have created a checking mechanism known as the Buchstabenwortwert (BWW) which is the sum of the values of each letter in a name. For instance, the BWW for \"cat\" is 3 + 1 + 20 = 24. I've calculated the BWW for all the locations and here they are in ascending order: 60  -  85  -  106  -  106  -  122  -  220  -  234 To compare, you simply need to input your guess into a BWW calculator. There are many available online, and here's one I usually use. Good luck and have fun with the rebuses!

For instance, 5 million (5 000 000) can be shortened to 5 x 106. The power of 10 is known as the order of magnitude. This is very useful as quantities in our universe span many orders of magnitude. For example, the number of atoms in the universe is estimated to be about 1080, which is 1 followed by a whopping 80 zeroes after it. There are many things we can measure: time, temperature, volume, but in this puzzle, we will be looking at the measurement of lengths and distances. This puzzle, like the video that inspired it, looks at the scale of lengths of our own Universe. We have explored, observed and studied the Universe across 40 orders of magnitude altogether. This is truly remarkable! To put things into perspective, this means that the smallest objects we know (fundamental particles) are 1040 times smaller than the largest thing we know (the Universe itself). Yes, that\u2019s a scale of 1:10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000! That\u2019s a lot of ground to cover, so let\u2019s get this hunt started! The Puzzle This is a geocaching puzzle, after all, so we are going to explore our world and see how we have gained insights into all these Powers of 10. Each range of powers will be linked to a particular location I need you to find on Google Earth, and once you find the location is found, you will be rewarded with a piece of the final coordinates.  Collect all 10, and you\u2019ll be ready to head out to find the cache. Have fun! Clue 1: 10-15 to 10-12 metres are the subatomic scales: the smallest realm that we have observed. This is the land of the subatomic particles, the building blocks of all the matter around us. Protons, neutrons and electrons occupy this scale of lengths, but recently we have discovered the existence of more exotic denizens of this realm. Hmm\u2026 but how and where were they discovered? Clue 2: 10-11 to 10-10 metres are the atomic scales: we are now looking at the size of atoms. The unit we use for 10-10 metres is also known as the Angstrom, in honour of Anders Jonas Angstrom, a Swedish physicist, who pioneered spectroscopy which deals with radiation of wavelengths in this region. Interestingly, the Ancient Greeks have speculated about the existence of these entities even before we could observe them. Today, we have conclusive proof of their existence and a giant monument to the atom can be found in a European city. Where is this giant atom? Clue 3: 10-9 to 10-8 metres brings us to the molecular scale:  still way too small to appreciate with the naked eye, but this is the realm of the structures that make up our bodies and which allows us to live. This is the where the DNA and RNA, the basic units that code for all of Life can be seen. For many years, scientists were baffled by the structure of the DNA, but in the 1930s, two biologists (and a female colleague, who sadly received less recognition than deserved) in a British laboratory managed to figure out the structure of the DNA. Where in Britain is this historic lab? Clue 4: 10-7 to 10-4 metres are the microscopic scales: the realm of the cells that make all living things and of course, the size of microbes (bacteria, protozoa and the like). This fascinating world of living organisms that were too small for our eyes to see was uncovered in the 17th century by a Dutch scientist who has been hailed as the Father of Microbiology for his work. He dabbled with the construction of the world\u2019s first microscopes, our gateway into the microscopic world. Some of his microscopes can be found in a museum in a Dutch city known for its university. Where is this place where one can still peer through his microscopes? Clue 5: 10-3 to 10-1 metres brings us at last to the macroscopic scales: the realm of the observable lengths. These are the small objects around us, from the thickness of our hair to the size of coins and small furniture. This is also the range of wavelengths associated with the microwaves and radio waves, which has been essential for the wireless transmission of information between us humans. Hmm\u2026 but could extra-terrestrial life also be sending us radio signals? Only one way to find out. We built one of our largest receivers of radio signals from space on a Caribbean island\u2026 where is this place? Clue 6: 100 or 1 metre is the basis for length measurements, but how do we all agree upon the length of one metre? No worries, somebody has this taken care of, because, in an institute somewhere in France, there is a metal bar that measures exactly 1 metre, along with a cylinder of mass exactly 1 kilogram. All measuring devices refer to these prototypes to ensure that their masses and lengths that they measure are precisely these exact quantitiesWhere are these sacred relics of our measurements? Clue 7: 101 to 103 metres: Alright, now we a beginning to go the distance! These are the lengths that we are used to travelling in, whether on our feet or on wheels, and boy, do we like to challenge ourselves to move fast! The world record for running 100 metres is under 10 seconds. Tell me, though, where in the world was the current (as of August 2014) 100-metre sprint record set? Clue 8: 104 to 106 metres: Now, we have moved into geographical scales, from the size of the mountains to the radius of the Earth. We have always been interested in going up into space, but have you wondered how far down into the Earth have we explored? Turns out, it is only an embarrassing 1.2 x 104 m, when some Russian geologists started drilling a deep hole out of sheer curiosity. They found some interesting things about the Earth\u2019s crust\u2026 but tell me, where is this hole? Clue 9: 108 to 1011 metres: Wow, now we are beginning to leave the Earth as we enter the realm of astronomical scales! We would never have been able to explore this realm with our eyes if we didn\u2019t have the telescope. It was used by a renowned Italian scientist of the 17th century who studied the Moon, Mars and discovered four of Jupiter\u2019s moons, which are 1011 metres away! He first demonstrated the uses of the telescope at the top of a famous landmark in one of Italy\u2019s most well known cities. Where is the landmark and which city is it in? Clue 10 1012 metres and beyond: These are the galactic scales, leading ultimately to the size of our universe. We believe that our observable Universe is about 1026 metres in size, but we really don\u2019t know how big the Universe actually is\u2026 meanwhile, closer to home, the furthest (ex-) planet in our own neighbourhood, the Solar System, is Pluto. You may not be aware of this, but, interestingly was named by a British 5-year old girl who passed the name to his grandpa, who conveyed it to the discoverers at an observatory. Where is the place where Pluto was first discovered? At last, we have reached the end of our journey through the Universe.

Collect the information from the various waypoints below (which was the circuit we took around the park), and solve for the final coordinates.  Bishan - Ang Mo Kio Park, as the name suggests, is a linear park along the banks of the upper Kallang River that straddles the neighbourhoods of Bishan and Ang Mo Kio. The river running through the park was once a concrete-lined canal, but an ambitious project undertaken in 2008 under the PUB ABC (Active, Beautiful, Clean) Rivers initiative has seen the canal transform into a \"natural\" river and floodwater catchment area. For the first time in decades, visitors were able to interact with the river ecoystem and watch the various animals, such as the herons and otters, live in their natural habitats. If you so wish, you can go ahead and frolick in the waters or hop on the rocks by the river. Thanks to CITO 2018, there's also a new cache to be found here!  This Multi-cache will show you some of the unique features of this park as you wander the banks of the river. WP1: Recycle Hill (N 001\u00b0 21.588', E 103\u00b0 50.893') We begin at the highest point of the Park, an artificial hillock called Recycle Hill. The concrete walls of the old Kallang River canal were stacked up here as a reminder of the river\u2019s past. At the summit is a prominent sculpture, titled \u201cEnclosure for a Swing\u201d. It does feature a swing within which inexplicably cannot swing, but still, it is a picturesque site. The number of \u201cloops\u201d that make up the sculpture = A WP2: The Floodplain (N 001\u00b0 21.493', E 103\u00b0 50.991') The wide river valley that meanders through the park not only serves as a scenic sight, but also helps in flood mitigation. The wider valley has a higher capacity, which comes in useful when there is a high volume of rainfall over the Pierce Reservoirs Catchment Area and the reservoir needs to discharge a large amount of water at once. However, this also means that the river\u2019s water level can rise drastically. An alarm at a station will sound when this happens, and you can find one of the stations here. The station number at this waypoint is SN\/[BC]. WP3: The Bishan Otters (N 001\u00b0 21.506', E 103\u00b0 51.036') One of the main attractions of the park is the Bishan Otter Family, whose many sightings captivated the attention of locals, and delighted those who were lucky enough to spot them. Their presence were a sign that the park was slowly transforming into a thriving natural ecosystem: an achievement given Singapore\u2019s urban environment. The numbers of red crosses on the sign here = D WP4: Going to the Birds (N 001\u00b0 21.574', E 103\u00b0 50.971') Along with the otters, many other uncommon fauna have made their home in the park, and this board tells you about some of the birds you can find here. The number of Bird Photos on the plaque = E WP5: The Winged Ones (N 001\u00b0 21.638', E 103\u00b0 50.884') Another board here tells you of the winged animals that lurk in the bushes and plants in the park. How many winged animals are featured on the board? That number is F (Hint: It's NOT 6) WP6: The Butterfly Garden (N 001\u00b0 21.656', E 103\u00b0 50.923') Across the stream is a small garden with plants that attract some of the more colourful residents of the park. The project was started by students and now, is maintained by NParks. The year the project was initiated was 201G. Final: The Crossing Your little walk is almost at its end! You\u2019ll find some respite on the other side of the river, but I am sure you want to claim your cache reward first.

The garden was first conceptualized in 1822 by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. He developed the first Botanic Gardens at Fort Canning. In 1859, the Gardens was founded at its present site by an Agri-Horticultural society.  Today, there are more than 10,000 plant species spread over the Gardens' 82 hectares area, which is about four times its original size in 1859. It receives about 4.5 million visitors annually and play an important role as a leading botanical institute.    Virtual Cache Logging Requirements: Choose your own adventure! Your objective is to collect a minimum of 10 points by visiting gardens and sites within the Botanic Gardens. There are a total of 14 gardens and 8 sites you can choose from, and they are worth different points. You can start your exploration from the cache coordinates at the Symphony Stage, or from any listed waypoint of your choice. At each waypoint, your visit has to be validated with a picture of either you or a personal object in front of the sign for the garden\/site, or in front of a unique object or plant inside the garden\/site. Pictures can be included in your log as individual photos or as a single collage, as long as the waypoint and you\/your personal object are visible.  [Updated on 31 July 2020] For ease of verification, your find log or picture captions should include the sites visited and points collected.  Bonus: If your outfit or your personal object in the photos feature any of the following, you earn 2 bonus points!\r (a) Plants or parts of plants (leaves, flowers, fruits, roots, etc); OR\r (b) Symbols\/messages promoting eco-friendliness or green energy.   Important Notes: (1) You are not required to visit all the waypoints to complete the task as you only need a minimum of 10 points. But if you do wish to visit all the waypoints, you are welcome to do so! (2) Admission Information: Singapore Botanic Gardens is open from 5 am to 12 midnight daily and admission is FREE.\r Note: There is admission charge for the National Orchid Garden or Waypoint \"GB\".

But, yet, a large and significant part of our shared history lay hidden within the lesser known tales behind the locations, establishments and buildings that still exist all around us. I have chosen a sampling of these fascinating yet relatively overlooked events and places on our little island nation, and included a brief write-up about their past below.   1942: The Punggol Beach Massacre took place where about 400 Chinese Civilians were executed by gunshot by the Japanese as part of Operation Sook Ching. A memorial to the victims now stand at the spot as a reminder of the atrocities that took place here. 1950: The Princess Elizabeth Estate in Upper Bukit Timah was built by the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) for the residents working in the industries located in the area. The estate was named in commemoration of the princess\u2019s wedding that year. 1974: The Singapore Cable Car began operations, linking Mount Faber, HarbourFront and Sentosa Island, becoming the world\u2019s first ropeway system to span a harbour, and it was built as part of a plan to promote tourism on Sentosa Island 1924: The construction of the Fullerton Building commenced on the former site of Fort Fullerton. The building began its life as the General Post Office building, but today, it is a posh hotel and a recognisable landmark of Marina Bay. 1908: Bidadari Cemetery was officially opened, and served as the main and largest Christian cemetery in Singapore until its closure in 1972. The graves were exhumed in 2006 for what will soon become a new HDB estate. 1951: The Singapore Red Swastika School was founded in Changi by the World Red Swastika Society as a means of providing free education to the poor students in the area. It has since moved to a larger premise and has grown to be well-known school in Singapore's Eastern Region. 2008: Tanglin Post Office, one of Singapore\u2019s oldest post offices, was demolished. An austere two-storey colonial bungalow, it was a landmark of the Tanglin area and later housed the offices of the Ministry of Science and Technology 1930: The Queen\u2019s Theatre began its operations in Geylang as the Wembley Cinema. The theatre was a renowned entertainment venue in the area for the next 52 years until its closure in 1982. The fa\u00e7ade of the building has been preserved and is now part of a commercial development. 1971: The Bedok Food Centre opened in Kampong Bedok. The food centre, famous for its chng tng, a local dessert, features a Minangkabau horned roof design, which is a tribute to the area\u2019s past as a Malay coastal village.   1890: The first blueprints of the Anguilla Mosque was drawn up. The mosque was built and named after Mohammed Salleh Eusoof Anguilla, who also donated the land for the mosque. This historic place of worship is now an important place of prayer for Muslims in Little India. 1956: A Mrs Sng acquired the land on which the last Kampong on mainland Singapore now stands. Kampong Lorong Buangkok (or Kampong Selak Kain) housed about 40 families in its heyday, but the land and the village is now threatened by development. 1950: The Church of Saint Alphosus was built by the renowed architectural firm Swan and Maclaren. The church, better known as Novena Church because of the prayer devotions that made the church famous, is the reason why the area and the nearby MRT station is known as Novena.

Once a nutmeg plantation, this lush and beautiful estate was converted into the homes of the senior officers of the Singapore Police Force. To keep themselves entertained and to maintain a healthy social life, the officers met regularly at the SPOM for dances, weddings, balls and feasts.  Even after the Second World War, the building did not lose its charm and function. Parties and gathering continue on in this fine building, even till this day. VIP, foreign dignitaries and ministers still have their meeting at the SPOM. It's hard not to marvel at this lovely specimen of the fusion between the refined shapes of Western architecture, and tropical colonial features, such as verandahs, balconies and a large porch to maximise ventilation in the humid tropical weather. Take a while to enjoy the quiet and serene area, listen to the birds chirping in the trees and maybe take a couple of photos... but that's not what you're here for. Ah, yes, about the cache... The Cache - Please read closely to avoid disappointment First, the cache is located at a spot that will provide a good view of the building, but still a respectable distance away so that your hunting will not arouse any suspicion among the staff. That being said, please do search discreetly and do not pose a hindrance to any vehicles and workers in the vicinity. Second, unlike many other caches, please use brute force to open the cache container. Don't worry about the container, it's made out of some stern stuff. Therefore, you have been warned: this cache is a tough nut to crack open. A flathead screwdriver or a similar tool will come in handy if you wish to avoid any broken fingernails.   Third, the cache only has space for a nano-sized logsheet, so it will not hold any trackables or trade items. Goes without saying, bring your own pen.  Fourth, feel free to log a DNF if you really cannot find the cache, Go ahead, I won't be offended or upset. Might even convince me to add a couple more hints. But, for now, all you are getting is the description I've provided above. Fifth and finally, no photos of the cache container or any spoilers in your logs!

Often they are absent, obstructed or impassable, making trips on foot difficult or impossible. A case in point is that around the CIQ there are pedestrian facilities, and in front of the nearby highrises 300m to the north, but the spaces in between have been overlooked. As a result, pedestrians between the highrises and a housing complex to the north have to wind through gaps and find ways past the various obstacles and discontinuities, including through grass and bushes. The routes taken by pedestrians making their way through the urban landscape are recorded in the form of tracks where they cross greenery or unpaved areas as 'desire lines' or beaten pathways showing where people walk through the dirt and bushes every day. These desire line pathways could well be used to guide roadway planners and designers looking to provide paved and continuous walkways, because they show the most convenient and popular pedestrian paths between points. There are multiple desire line pathways around this cache area.","hint":"travel adapting","total_found":"14","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8599305,"code":"GC9QE2W","name":"RAMS Grave Hill","geocacheType":2,"containerType":8,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":2.0,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":1,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.3356166667,"longitude":103.8387666667,"ownerId":"PR140FYZ","ownerName":"Ponpon1961","placedDate":"2022-03-27","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-09","lastFoundTime":"19:23:25","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9QE2W","description":"Grave Hill is located at Toa Payoh West.

Getting to this cache from the CIQ, which is 600m away in a straight line, is an obstacle-strewn 2.5km walk via the inner ring road from the north, or a slightly less obstructed 2km walk via the inner ring road from the south. For the intrepid, the south approach via the elevated walkway to Princess Cove is the better option on foot. The inaccessibilty results in an almost rural feel to the area despite the central location. Just across the road from the cache are some pens with attentive and apparently curious goats housed in them. The goats are allowed out to graze around 6-7pm on most evenings, probably making it impossible to retrieve the cache at those times. Back around the 1970s or 1980s when the nearby apartments were built (70s, judging from the beatifully retro facade), this was a quiet, green, low density, secluded getaway for the wealthy, and not too much has changed today. Things may change in the near future as the paved outdoor parking lots (those 1970s developments were less car-oriented and didn't include off-street parking) offering 7 ringgit per day parking are an extremely unproductive use of such potentially prime land and always a precursor to future development. The parking lot north of the retro apartments adjacent to the cache was a forested area until 2019, and other sites around the area are being cleared, likely gearing up for much-needed densification considering the close proximity to the massive land reclamation at Princess Cove to the south, Bukit Senyum to the north and the CBD and CIQ to the west.","hint":"troll","total_found":"8","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8185869,"code":"GC99HW7","name":"One Hundred Sixty-one Metres Series (13)","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.328,"longitude":103.704083,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2021-04-17","lastFoundDate":"2023-04-26","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC99HW7","description":"For those who like to be out for a stroll\/hike and quantity hunt.

We logged that find under another account, and only switched over to this one to log what was technically our find #2 (Singapore Monopoly Series: Tax Me Maybe). Anyhow, we both thought that first caching experience was Very Cool, and started going after more traditionals, then puzzles (another long-time passion), and next thing you know we were wading through canals, hanging precariously off ledges, climbing into the crater of a volcano, and seeing the world in a way we hadn\u2019t before. Not only have we been brought to places we never would have discovered, we\u2019ve met all manner of interesting and wonderful and slightly mad people. And I say mad in the most affectionate way, because when I think of geocachers, I think of this quote from Jack Kerouac that I\u2019ve always loved: \u201cthe only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars\u2026\u201d (Also, we\u2019ve learned more about rocks than we care to admit).

Only reason I would not consider it wheelchair accessible is the location might be a bit of a squeeze for a wheelchair.","hint":"near to 40","total_found":"44","total_did_not_find":"4"},{"id":8185144,"code":"GC99H3V","name":"One Hundred Sixty-one Metres Series (1)","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.334567,"longitude":103.696767,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2021-04-16","lastFoundDate":"2023-04-26","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC99H3V","description":"For those who like to be out for a stroll\/hike and quantity hunt.

Too many, sometimes, that we have to pick and choose the best ones to see the light of day. Occasionally, this leads to analysis paralysis or the fear that it\u2019ll not be good enough, and we end up not publishing caches for the longest time. Then, there are times when you think an idea is absolutely the best thing invented since sliced bread\u2026 and the execution falls flat on its face. I suppose you could say that these ones are ill-conceived - not quite yet ready to come out of the oven and needed to be carried to term. Perhaps they needed more thought, a little extra sugar and spice, a defter hand to construct or maybe\u2026 it really was dead on arrival, so to speak. But, still, it was published, and its ugly head is there for all to see. So, you hang your head in shame, and maybe proceed to quietly archive it one day, when no one notices. This is the story of one of mine \u2013 which is well and truly, a half-baked idea. This cache was originally the final for \u201cLet Them Eat Kueh!\u201d, which was supposed to be a delectable puzzle about some local treats \u2013 but I somehow misunderstood how the website worked, which mangled the code, and left it intractable. I sat on this for a while\u2026 and on the suggestion of a fellow geocacher who hated to see this nice cache go to waste, here it is, in its \u201csecond life\u201d as a Traditional Cache.  The location of the cache itself, is an interesting, if not slightly obscure one. It\u2019s now marked on Google Maps as the \u201cGoldhill Avenue cul-de-sac\u201d. It\u2019s a very serene patch of green and grassland in the middle of a colonial estate which, as the clich\u00e9 goes, \u201creally doesn\u2019t feel like Singapore\u201d. The \u201cpark\u201d, if you can call it that, has no official name on maps as far as I can tell, but I suspect it really wasn\u2019t meant to be a park in the usual sense.  My personal hypothesis about the place is that it came about during the construction of the Second Bukit Timah Diversion Canal, which links the section of the Bukit Timah Canal just after Singapore Chinese Girls\u2019 School and the Kallang \u2013 Whampoa River system. The \u201cpark\u201d sits on top of an underground portion of the canal and serves to conceal\/host the maintenance entrances to the canal.  In any case, it\u2019s a lovely place to visit and explore at any time of the day. I discovered the area by accident one night, many years back, when I was cycling around the estate, but there are a few people who do come by deliberately for walks and birdwatching. It\u2019s a bit of a chore to get to by foot from Malcolm Road or Dunearn Road, though, but the walk is a pleasant one for most parts through the quiet estate streets.

He had heard the myth that it was supposed to be one of those unlucky days. He never found out why, though, but today, that superstition couldn\u2019t be any truer. He had been in the mosquito-infested rubber plantation on the ridge for a few days now, and hope is running out. The bombardment had been non-stop; punctuating the sound of buzzing insects in his ear were mortar explosions that made his ear ring. In all his years of military training, he has never been more shaken. It was neither the insects nor the explosions that shook him to the core; it was the threat of death, a sudden, unforeseen death. His regiment was severely outnumbered by the unrelenting enemy, who had taken the western part of the island by storm. They had captured Reformatory Road with ease, wiping out the troops that were stationed there, and he was next. He could not run away, his stand is the all that remains between the enemy lines and the city. If the ridge falls, the city would be defenceless, and that would be a disaster beyond his, or even his superiors\u2019 imaginations. So, he will hold the fort... It was 0213 hours, and the enemy was advancing onto the ridge. He and his regiment had retreated to Point 270, which he had been ordered to hold at all costs. It was a strategic location for it was the highest point in the area. There is an outpost there, built a couple of decades before the war. He and his men chose to shelter here as the bombardment continued. Deep in the recesses of his mind, he knew that they could not hold their lines for much longer, but he still maintained a veneer of confidence, lest his uncertainty further lower the morale of his men who he knew were as afraid as he was. So, he would continue to hold the fort... He reached into his pocket and took out his most prized possession. It wasn\u2019t worth much, but it meant the world to him. It was a gift from his mother, who must certainly be worried sick for him. It was his duty to defend his family. However, he knew he will not last long. The enemy were said to be particularly cruel and from the tales he heard, they will kill every last person who fought against them, regardless of rank or race. He had to hide it away, or it would be lost forever in the hands of the enemy...  The Cache Good luck and enjoy the GZ! The cache is a small container hidden in a little hidey hole. The Route There are two ways one can get to the GZ, from the bottom of the ridge or from the top. The route from the bottom starts at the carpark outside the S1A building. It is a longer route, but the climb is less steep. The route from the top is much shorter but beware of the steep slopes. GZ is not within the fenced area around the water tank, so don't climb in and, for those who drive, note that there's no (legal) parking spot there. Whichever way you choose, do not take unnecessary risks and best not to attempt this at night.

Dipterocarp means \"two-winged fruit\" and this name is derived from the two- to five-winged fruits that this family of trees produces. With a great diversity of leaf forms and some 500 species existing in our region, Dipterocarps (also known as forest giants) are iconic trees that constitute the backbone of Indo-Malayan rainforests and is unique to this region. They can live up to 1,000 years old, grow up to 80metres, and are commonly used for timber. However, many of these forests in the region have diminished over the years. The Dipterocarp Arboretum showcases more than 800 trees of over 70 species. It is designed to help visitors learn more about the unique features of the Dipterocarps and witness the growth of the young saplings into tall majestic trees over many years. The different groups of Dipterocarps featured here are Dipterocarpus, Shorea, Hopea (these being the 3 main groups), and Anisoptera, Dryobalanops, Neobalanocarpus, Parashorea, Vatica.   But enough about trees. Around the park, you can find 2 types of educational puzzles for children, in which they have to substitute letters into symbols to form sentences. You can find one of each close to the posted coordinates.

Things have been going slowly, and my tiredness isn\u2019t helping with progress either. Maybe it\u2019s just cabin fever from being cooped up for so long, after all, getting around isn\u2019t as easy as used to be. I was getting really sleepy. Even as music from the Youtube Player, playing the 40-minute medley of \"I Am The Doctor\", turned to comfortable volume attempted to keep me awake, I was slowly dozing off... ...and I found myself in an entirely different place, worlds apart from what I was used to. A console stood in the centre of the room, with levers, flashing lights, screens and even some strange odds and ends, things that don\u2019t usually belong here but were modified to function as part of the machine itself. The place looked surprisingly familiar, where have I seen it before? Was it in a play, a movie or a book? Hmm... Suddenly, it struck me. Of course, this is the TARDIS console! Oh, my goodness me, the layout was unmistakable, the iconic blue door and the cyclical whirring noise of the TARDIS manipulating the Time Vortex. It was at that stage, I knew someone was missing, the owner of the blue box that could travel through all of time and space. I wondered which regeneration of his (or could it be, at some point, her?) It was at that very moment, however, a screen flickered to life... On the screen was the Time Lord himself, complete with that iconic bowtie and tweed jacket (and for those who are uninitiated, yes, I\u2019m referring to the Eleventh Doctor). He was trying to say something, but all I could hear is static, he seemed to be in some distress, his bowtie was slightly askew and his hair ruffled. I could make a few words out, something about \u201cElizabeth\u201d, \u201cHelp\", \u201cfind him\u201d and \u201cThe Bard\u201d. The transmission ended as he was dragged away by some men in 17th century clothing. I was perplexed, he obviously needed help and without the TARDIS, he had no way to leave the current era he is currently trapped in. Perhaps I could pilot the TARDIS to him, but even then, I had no idea where on Earth and when in time he even was. Perhaps, I could glean some hints from the transmission. I racked my brain for prominent women named Elizabeth from throughout history. What were the connections between these names? After a while, I had it figured out and it all made sense. Now, the task is reduced to merely figuring out the exact coordinates of his location. Where could the clues to that possibly lay?

There is a legal way to access this cache from Mount Rosie Road.  Welcome to Mount Rosie Road, a leafy road steeped in history and heritage trees. Tucked within the colonial estates of Malcolm Park, this area has been home to the upper crust of Singaporean society since the late 19th century.   While the black-and-white bungalows of the area are the \u201cstar\u201d attractions, Mount Rosie Road was originally built to serve one very prominent residence. In fact, it was effectively the private driveway of one Mr. Theodore Heinrich Sohst, a German merchant whose bungalow once stood atop the hill. The bungalow was probably constructed in the 1880s and it was likely that Mr. Sohst planted the many century-old lichi (or lychee) trees that line the road \u2013 one of which has been designated as a Heritage Tree by NParks.  The road was in fact initially named for Mr. Sohst, but was changed to Mount Rosie Road, in honour of his wife, the eponymous Ms. Rosie de Souza. Their bungalow was eventually sold and changed hands several times. Most prominently, the bungalow served a short stint as Flagstaff House, the headquarters of the colonial War Office for a time in the 1920s. The bungalow was eventually demolished, and the land slowly reclaimed by forest.   What you see today is a little odd: Mount Rosie Road seems to abruptly change names to Goldhill Avenue at a bend in the road, but that is because the latter was deliberately extended to meet the former. However, if you do look a little closer \u2013 Mount Rosie \u201ccontinues\u201d a little further into the shrubbery. This older \u201croad\u201d gently ascends Mount Rosie around the perimeter of 24 Mount Rosie Road, possibly to where the old bungalow used to be. It\u2019s a pleasant little walk on the secondary forest fringe, and you\u2019ll find the cache along the walk.

This traditional cache brings you to explore what\u2019s left of Boh Sua Tian Road and the village that it once served.   Boh Sua Tian Village Boh Sua Tian means \u201cwireless\u201d in Hokkien, and the area takes its name from the Royal Air Force (RAF) Wireless Receiving Station that was once here. The station buildings, only recently demolished in 2019, served the nearby Seletar Airbase and was a prominent landmark for this area along Yio Chu Kang Road.  The area around the station was home to a thriving agricultural community and rubber plantations \u2013 and was a holdout of the dying village lifestyle in Singapore that lasted until the late 1980s. The two villages in the area were: a Chinese one, named Kampong Boh Sua Tian located just off the 10th mile of Yio Chu Kang Road, and a Malay village, named Kampong Pengkalan Petai, on the banks of the now-flooded Sungei Seletar.  Boh Sua Tian Road and Tunnel  Boh Sua Tian Road, which linked the villages to the rest of the world, wound its way north from Yio Chu Kang Road and branched into a series of lorongs or lanes that led to the farms and residences of the villagers. What\u2019s left of this junction can be seen on the north side of Yio Chu Kang Road, just before the Yio Chu Kang flyover as you travel eastwards along the road. The spot were the villages used to sit on has been cleared during the construction of the CTE-TPE-SLE interchange and for upcoming developments. In fact, the interchange flyover was named Boh Sua Tian Flyover for a short while before being renamed to Seletar Flyover.  Today, a short section of the road between Yio Chu Kang Road and the village remains but is slowly reclaimed by nature. The western part between Yio Chu Kang Road and the tunnel under the CTE is heavily wooded and can be a slight challenge to bash through, while the section after the tunnel straddles the east side of the CTE with a large grassy field on the other side. The road is accessible from both sides with a bit of courage and a sense of adventure without any trespassing, though you ought to be prepared for some mild bashing or rummaging through a lalang field depending on which side you take. The Cache  The cache is located on the West side of the tunnel, at the base of a three-trunked tree just off the side of the road.  Look for a shoe (or what\u2019s left of it) and the cache will be revealed to you.  Whichever way you choose to get to GZ, do be careful! A few uncovered drains, slightly hidden by vegetation exist around the road and the nearby field. While they are not particularly deep or wide, they can lead to a gash or sprain if you unwittingly step into them.

The ensuing brouhaha would have gotten the government involved and who knows what would happen to her project? Putting on her headphones once again, she turned the telescope to the same location in the constellation of Vega. Poring over the previous output, while holding the headphones close to her ear, she muttered, \u201cYes, it\u2019s still the same\u201d. She continued listening, and the signal kept pulsing on\u2026 It was just before 3:15 am that very night when the computer signalled that something had changed. Something was amiss. Ellie stood up, snatched the headphone from the console, pressed it to her ear and listened. She held her breath as each pulse came through, and with a pencil, she matched each pulse with the previous output, but, alas, every one of the hundreds of signals was exactly the same as before. She sunk into her seat, nearly resigned to the fact that it was nothing but a false alarm. She clasped her hands and listened to the beats that she has come to know so well. Then, something struck her, there was something odd about the sound of the signal\u2026 it just didn\u2019t sound right, as if there was another signal else interfering with it. She ran to the next computer terminal, and filtered out the original frequencies from the pulse. There was the expected silence, but\u2026 there was a faint crackle. Scarcely believing what she heard, she ran the signal through the amplifier and there it was\u2026 an unmistakable second set of signals, more complex than the first. First, there was a long signal, lasting for several seconds, followed by five shorter pulses. Could this be another message?

As with all puzzle caches, the cache is not at the published coordinates, and you must solve the puzzle to find the final coordinates.      Ah, yes, the Kanto Region! The place where it all began. Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s first set of games, Red and Blue (and subsequently, a Pikachu-based remake, Pok\u00e9mon Yellow), were set in the Kanto Region, which was loosely based off the region of the same name in Japan. If you played the games from the very start, like I did, your Pok\u00e9mon Adventure would have begun in Pallet Town as did the most iconic (and soon-to-be retired, at time of writing) Pok\u00e9mon Trainer of all, Ash Ketchum.    Kanto, is, of course, the native region of the first 151 Pok\u00e9mon as per the Pok\u00e9dex, and also where the base mechanics and premise for all the main series games that came after it were first introduced i.e. to catch Pok\u00e9mon, train them up, battle other trainers and finally, beat the Pok\u00e9mon League to be the region\u2019s Champion. It was a formula that started in here and has persisted 26 years and counting, and somehow, we are not even tired of it.  This puzzle, however, takes its source material on the most recent remake of the Kanto region games: Let\u2019s Go Pikachu and Let\u2019s Go Eevee. These two games are a Nintendo Switch remake of Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, which drew upon the popularity of Ash\u2019s partner Pikachu to further promote the franchise. The games also innovated by borrowing their Pok\u00e9mon catching mechanic from another popular franchise spinoff, Pok\u00e9mon Go, with the hopes of using its popularity to (re)introduce a new generation of Trainers to the region that started it all.  In any case, I suppose it\u2019s time you embark on your own route to unravel this puzzle, so here are some snapshots from my journey which will hopefully inspire you.   Note: You need not own or have played the game to be able to solve this puzzle. Resources, such as Bulbapedia, will have all the information you need... and while you are here, you might as well wade into the tall grass to get to this cache.

While it is undoubtedly a poetic end to a anthology of philosophical musings, the phrase gained a significance of its own when a torn-out page containing these two words were found on a dead body in Adelaide, Australia in 1948. You can read about the mystery in detail here and once you have soaked up all the intrigue, you can take a shot at the puzzle below.

It goes into some detail, with historical manuscripts and even lists of the people involved in drafting it (which apparently included a UK law firm with a Singapore branch office); an impressive amount of attention and historical documentation for a provincial-level 'constitution' that probably nowadays has only as much legal effect as any other piece of legislation in Johor. The upper floor focuses obsessively on a couple of obscure literary and educational figures but there's not a whole lot there about the social, economic or cultural development of the city.

When it comes to using the telescope, time is of the essence. Hundreds of research projects bid for telescope time every year, and only a lucky few actually win the lottery, so to speak. Her partner enters the coordinates for the first of their targets for the night, and they wait for the telescope to adjust itself. The behemoth of a telescope accedes to the command of the astronomers and slowly adjusts the telescope\u2019s line of sight. As the gears turn, Ellie looks out the window into the night sky. She always felt alone since the passing of her father and her greatest mentor, who had first brought her to the telescope when she was only six. She remembered how impressed she was when she saw the telescope\u2019s dish, built into a deep valley in the mountains. Today, she still counts herself impressed every day she steps into the control room. \u201cTruly an engineering marvel\u201d, she lamented, \u201cand a pity that no one wants builds more of these beauties\u201d. Funding for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is erratic and she has done her level best to convince others that this was a worthwhile endeavour.   As the signals from the distant star cluster streamed in at last, she recalled the times her father taught her to tune the family radio to listen to white noise, and her amazement when he told her that the signals were from distant galaxies\u2026 Her thoughts were interrupted by set of loud low frequency sounds emitted by their device\u2019s speakers. It seemed as if the machine had come to life and she was listening to its heartbeat. \u201cWow, what is that?\u201d Ellie asked her colleague. \u201cA very strong periodic signal of some sort\u2026 though, it\u2019s not as regular as we\u2019d expect from a pulsar.\u201d \u201cThe signals\u2026 what frequency are we listening in to right now?\u201d \u201cIn the range of 2380 MHz. There\u2019s another set\u201d, her colleague said while turning a knob, \u201cat a slightly lower frequency.\u201d   The pulses kept streaming in and the machine announced the arrival of each with a mechanical pulse. They tried to determine the period between each high and low frequency pulses, but there seems to be no way to predict which pulse would arrive next. After two minutes, the pulses stopped as suddenly as they began. The two astronomers looked at the data collected (A = lower frequency pulse and B = higher frequency pulse): FIRST CONTACT UTM: 19Q 737479 2029730\r UTC: 20:15:24 BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABBAAABBAAAAAABAAA BAAAAABBBAABBAABBAABAAABAAAAABBAAABAAAAB AAAAAAAAAAAABAAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAABAABABAAAAAAAABAAABBBBABAABAABABAA AAABAAAAABAAABAABABAABABAABAAAABAAAABAAB AABABABBBBBBABAAAAABAABAABABABBBBBBBABAA AABAABAABABABBBBBBAAABAAABAABABAABABAABA AABBBBABAABAABABAAAAABAAAAAAAABAABABAAAA AAAABAAAAAAABAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAABAAAAAABBAABAA BAAAAAAAABBAAAABBBBABBBBBBAABBBABBBAABBB BBBBBBBBBBABABABBBBABBBBBBBBBBBBAABBBABB BAAABBBBABAABAAAAAAAABBAAAAABBAAAAABAAAA AAAABAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAABBBABABAAABABABABABABAABBBAAAAAAAA ABABABABAAAAAAAAAAAABAAABABAAAAAAAAAABAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAABBBBABBBBA ABBBBBAAAAAAABBAAAABBBABABBBABAAAAAABAAB ABABBBAABBBAABAAAAABABBABBABAAABBBAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAABABAAABBBBABABBABBABAAABAB AAABAABABBABABAABAAABABAAABAABABBBAAAABB AABBABBAABBBBABBBBABBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAAABA AAAAAAAAAABAABBBAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAABBBBB ABAAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAABAAABAAABAAABA As they looked for a pattern, the pulses started streaming in again.

The area is planned to include a five-star hotel, residences, serviced apartments, a shopping mall, an office tower and the new headquarters of Johor Baru City Council, Menara MBJB. Of these, by mid-2020 the City Council and first two towers are built and open, with cleared sites but little sign of construction commencing on the others. Tellingly, while the area is very difficult to reach on foot, a dedicated tunnel connecting to the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine complex, which is advertised as 'a minute\u2019s drive away', is planned. Yet it is only 800m from the Menara MBJB at One Bukit Senyun to the CIQ. Surely better to build an attractive elevated walkway like the one connecting to Princess Cove (which is a similar distance with a walkway of 650m), rather than encouraging people to drive to the CIQ complex while deterring pedestrians? And when the time required for waiting for a taxi or car-share pickup (if not driving) or parking (if driving) is included, 'a minute's drive away' is a fantasy and walking is always going to be faster. The inner ring road on the southern perimeter of One Bukit Senyum severs it from the whole CBD and CIQ area to the south, including the site of the planned RTS rail connection to Singapore. With the RTS due to start construction in late 2020 and be completed by the mid-2020s, hopefully better pedestrian connections between One Bukit Senyum and the CBD and CIQ will arrive before then, but until this happens it's not a very easy walk despite the proximity. The impressive architecture of the City Council building didn't quite extend to the street level, with more attention by the project's starchitects to the skyline than the street. Rather than presenting a welcoming and active facade at the street level where people actually experience the city, the building is fenced and ringed by car parking access lanes. Still, the street has been nicely landscaped and even includes seating sections. It's not clear they were actually designed as seating, but they are pleasant places to take a break - and grab a cache.","hint":"black hole","total_found":"10","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8334343,"code":"GC9EHBP","name":"RC-S\\15","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.2953,"longitude":103.798267,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2021-07-31","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-26","lastFoundTime":"15:42:12","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9EHBP","description":"Deploying a series of caches for the famous Rail Corridor from the central - ie the Bukit Timah Railway Station venue.

By a strange twist of luck and fate, this puzzle made her famous across the world. Now, I actually knew Cheryl (side fact: her surname is Ong) before the whole birthday thing came about. She happens to be a huge fan of puzzles and loves to pose such teasers to all who know her. After some persuasion, she has set up a little mystery cache to test the logical deduction skills of our local cachers. She was impressed upon hearing about the skills we possess and the puzzles we create and solve. Now, she wants to put them to the test. This is the story of Cheryl\u2019s Cache.  Cheryl contacted three cachers: me (Zach) and the two other cachers (let\u2019s call them CC and LL) and she arranged for us to meet her at a secret location (she\u2019s quite shy, and doesn\u2019t want all those pesky reporters to be following her around, pressuring her for the date of her birthday). She set us two puzzles to solve, one for the North coordinates of her cache and the other for the East. Puzzle 1: Cheryl:  Alright guys, I will now get you to figure out the North coordinates. In this first puzzle, I will whisper the second last digit of the coordinates to the team consisting of CC & LL and then, whisper the last digit of the coordinates to Zachary, and, finally, present everyone with a list of possible coordinates. \u2026and so, just like in the birthday puzzle, both of us received one half of the required information, and, we looked through the list of possible North coordinates: The coordinates are N01 19.0(A)(B), and A and B could be the following set of numbers:  After looking through the digits, the three of us exchanged knowing glances. After taking a little more time for rumination, our discussion took an oddly familiar turn\u2026 CC + LL: We don\u2019t know the full coordinates, and we are very sure that Zach doesn\u2019t know the answer, too. Zach: Indeed, I didn\u2019t know it previously, but now, with your statement, I do know the answer! CC + LL: Ah, and now we know the answer, too! Cheryl: Well done, guys! Looks like you have studied the problem I posed Albert and Bernard quite thoroughly. Ah, but I have another trick up my sleeves\u2026 Cheryl rubbed her hands in glee as we sat there waiting for the next challenge that Cheryl will pose. Judging by the tone of her voice, this one was going to be a tad bit trickier\u2026 Puzzle 2:   \u201cWhat fiendish variation of the puzzle will she come up with now?\u201d I thought, as Cheryl dug into her purse and unfolded a piece of paper with yet more digits on them. Cheryl cleared her throat, her voice breaking the anticipation-laced silence that had hung heavily in the air over the last minute or so.   Cheryl: For the East coordinates, I will share three digits instead of the previous two. The East coordinates are E103 50. (X)(Y)(Z), and this time, I will whisper the value of X, Y and Z to CC, LL and Zach respectively. As always, you cannot share the digit I have told you with the others and I will present to you a list of possible combinations of X, Y and Z. Here they are: These are the 22 possible combinations of values for X, Y, and Z:  As she had promised, Cheryl whispered the one digit each into our ears, and after that we set about to our task. Looking at the long list of digits presented, we started working at the seemingly impossible task of making sense of all the data before us. We sat there in silence for a few moments with furrowed brows and the occasional stroking of chins, punctuated by murmurs of \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d CC was the first to reach for the pencils and paper that Cheryl had graciously provided for us and organising the numbers we had. The rest of us followed suit soon after that, furiously scribbling the dates along with some notes on the margins. The atmosphere was tense as we tried to make sense of what we had, and at long last, I had finally gathered my thoughts sufficiently to make a declaration: Zach: I don\u2019t know the correct coordinates, but based on what I know, I am 100% certain LL doesn\u2019t know the correct solution either. LL: You\u2019re right, Zach, I really didn\u2019t know the answer, and I still don\u2019t know what it is yet. But, I am also sure that CC doesn\u2019t know the correct solution, too. CC: Indeed\u2026 that makes all three of us. After listening to your statements, I still don\u2019t know the answer. I guess we\u2019re all stuck, Cheryl! This second puzzle of yours is definitely a stumper! Cheryl stood up and walked around looking at what we\u2019ve scribbled down so far, muttering an occasional \u201cmm\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d and nodding her head. She seemed satisfied (with a modicum of smugness, perhaps?) with our progress so far. At last, she returned to her seat and said: Cheryl: Impressive, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d make it this far in a single sitting. To nudge you along, here\u2019s a little hint: \u201c241\u201d are not the coordinates of my cache\u2026 does it help? CC: Sorry, Cheryl, I am afraid that doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019m still stuck. What about you, Zach? Zach: No, sorry, I am still stuck, too. That was of no help to me. The dejection on our faces was apparent: we had spent nearly an hour on the puzzle but we had got nowhere. We were about to throw in the towel when LL looked up from his scribbles with a triumphant smile on his face\u2026 LL: Eureka! I\u2019ve got it! I\u2019ve GOT IT! That sudden uplifting of the mood spurred on CC and I, and we both returned to our work so far. Almost simultaneously, the two of us looked up and right into each other\u2019s eyes, and proclaimed: CC and Zach: We solved it! Oh my\u2026 this puzzle really can be solved! Cheryl: Congratulations, guys! You\u2019ve got the coordinates for my cache! You can go find the cache now, or would you rather stay and have dinner first?  Final Notes: I will only add in a geocheck link after FTF has been taken (due to the fact that this puzzle can be brute-forced under certain circumstances). Since this is a logic puzzle, there ought to only be one solution to the puzzle. You may e-mail me presonally to check your answer for now, if needed.

Recently, I\u2019ve taken to joining a friend of mine\r who is conducting a survey of the birds of Kent Ridge on long walks\r on the top of the ridge. While there, I\u2019ve discovered many\r secrets guarded closely by the guardian forests, and one of them\r was represented by the nearby cache \u201cPoint 270\u201d.  One of the most\r striking things as you walk along the ridge is the presence of\r colonial bungalows, many of which command excellent views of the\r surrounding areas. Some of these buildings have been abandoned for\r some decades after the British left, hiding dark and interesting\r secrets within. These bungalows were home to the British officers\r who used to serve at the Buona Vista Barracks, which used to stand\r where National University Hospital (NUH) is today. Recent\r renovations to these buildings by the National University of\r Singapore (NUS) for research facilities have uncovered some rather\r interesting documents, like these which I\u2019ll recount to you\r right now...  Many of the bungalows\r in the area predate World War II, and it is quite a feat to see\r many of them still standing today. My favourite bungalow is 4, Kent\r Ridge Road, one that stands atop a hillock facing the sea, (or what\r is today, Pasir Panjang Port). I first visited the house years ago\r when I was there for a module. The supervisor for that module, an\r archaeology professor, managed to acquire that house to store his\r dig collections, which amounts to crate after crate of ceramic\r shards from around the region, and it also functions as a lab to\r wash, sort and process them. The house was just simply filled with\r these forgotten treasures from places ranging from the lost island\r of Pulau Saigon (in Singapore, no less!) to a mysterious Kota Cina\r in Sumatra. While there, I found an old envelop lodged under one of\r the crates. I removed it and I found three scraps of paper inside.\r Here\u2019s the first one:    Next, there was a\r letter that referenced the incident at Point 270. It read:  I\u2019m afraid\r the boys can\u2019t hold on for much longer, my love. Point 270\r may fall by noon, today, and along with it, the house which we\r shared so many fond memories in. I bought this gift for you for it\r is a special day tomorrow, but I won\u2019t be able to see your\r smile when you receive it. I\u2019ll leave a coded letter in this\r house detailing where I hid it. If you value our relationship and\r return to the home we built, you\u2019ll find these letters. But\r will you? This is a chance I must take. Remember those codes we\r used to write each other? This will be my final message to you, the\r key lies in remembering this day and place: the day I gave my life\r for you.   Finally, the aforementioned coded letter: HNTITUHD SHUGJJSZ NQTSGHSQ YUSUY HIG SBDAH NWEIY YTGYX CTJFB THNSU ZDJHB COOYX GEYXH JUBBV QXCOA\r GFSJB GKUTC JBPBU ACBDX UGJCO QVYWT APHDZ ACLOH SPOEH PNFNC UXJAV\r UTCNH DTABB UFAZN YBDCE BBAEV XCZTS LJTUI ESYXJ HSAUF SAEFM GJYLV\r URWOP ABDGE SGAEW IOYBHN The cache should be an easy find, but I can\u2019t quite make\r sense of the coded letter. The first line seems to be parsed like\r normal words, but the rest of the letter are parsed in blocks of\r five. Hmm... could it be the easiest part of the cipher? Good luck\r finding GZ because I can\u2019t figure this out, but I\u2019ve\r got a good idea of where it might be... also, for it to survive the\r decades of development in the area, I could guess that it\u2019s\r probably a micro cache and you\u2019ll have to BYOP.","hint":"1) you don't need to go to point 270, but reading the listing and the logs might help.2) begin by decrypting the first line of the cipher. think george orwell but a different year. 3) as with any historical event, dates and places are important.4)kryptos","total_found":"17","total_did_not_find":"3"},{"id":8199978,"code":"GC9A1HB","name":"One Hundred Sixty-one Metres Series (1I)","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.34,"longitude":103.68545,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2021-04-24","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-24","lastFoundTime":"12:31:34.4066519","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9A1HB","description":"For those who like to be out for a stroll\/hike and quantity hunt.

The commander of Allied forces, Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, did not expect the Japanese to make their main attack in the west, and failed to reinforce the Australian 22nd Brigade, which took the brunt of the assault. The main Japanese objective to the immediate rear of the beach was Tengah Airfield. \r At 8.30pm on 8 February, Australian machine gunners opened fire on vessels carrying a first wave of 4,000 troops from the 5th and 18th Divisions towards the Island. The Japanese assaulted the Beach, which was held by the 22nd Brigade.   Fierce fighting raged all day but eventually the increasing Japanese numbers \u2014 as well as their superiority in artillery, planes and military intelligence \u2014 began to take their toll. The Japanese exploited gaps in the thinly-spread Allied lines such as rivers and creeks. By midnight, the two Australian brigades had lost communications with each other and the 22nd Brigade was forced to retreat. At 1am, further Japanese troops were landed and the last Australian reserves went in.   Towards dawn on 9 February, some elements of the 22nd Brigade had been overrun or surrounded, and the 2\/18th Australian Infantry Battalion, in the centre, had lost more than half of its personnel. The 2\/20th Australian Infantry Battalion, on the right flank was also heavily committed. At the same time, the 2\/19th Australian Infantry Battalion, on the left, was being outflanked, and only \"B\" Company faced the initial landings by the Japanese.\r  \r Percival maintained a belief that further landings would occur in the northeast and did not agree to reinforce the 22nd Brigade until Tengah Airfield itself was threatened. However, before limited British and Indian infantry reinforcements arrived, the badly-battered Australian and Singaporean units, along with the Jinds, had retreated to take up positions on the \"Jurong Line\", stretching south from the village of Bulim. Tengah Airfield was taken by the Japanese at around midday on 9 February.\r  \r Shortly after dark on 9 February, three British Fairmile B motor launches were sent on a raid up the western channel of the Straits of Johor, adjoining the Beach. Their objective was to attack Japanese landing craft and communications. They came under fire from enemy forces on both shores, but pressed on almost as far as the causeway. A few Japanese landing craft were sunk before the launches returned down the channel, reaching the island safely and suffering minimal damage. Some Allied soldiers saw this as an example of effective defensive tactics that were used too little and\/or too late by their senior commanders.

Quick History Extracted from Wikipedia as usual    The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore is a statutory board under the Ministry of Finance of the Singapore Government in charge of tax collection.    The Singapore Income Tax Department was created in 1947 to administer the Income Tax Ordinance enacted during that year.   Actual assessing of tax only began in November 1948. In the first Year of Assessment, about 40,000 individual tax returns and 1,000 corporate returns were received. The total tax collected for the period 1 January 1948 to 31 December 1949 was $33.2 million.   Following self-government in 1959, the Inland Revenue Department was formed in 1960 when various revenues administered and collected by a number of separate agencies were brought together.   When Singapore attained independence on 9 August 1965, substantial changes were made to the Income Tax Act, which came into effect on 1 January 1966.   By 1970, the number of Acts that came under the Department's purview had increased to twelve. That year also saw the appointment of the first local Commissioner, Mr Hsu Tse-Kwang.   From the 1970s, substantial resources were devoted to staff training. In 1972, microfilming was stepped up to save space and reduce file handling. Property tax billing and collection were also computerised.   IRD's ever-expanding role, together with the rapid increase in the number of taxpayers, resulted in an acute staff shortage. There was a very large backlog of tax not assessed and tax not collected. In addition, IRD staff were highly sought after by the private sector because of their specialised training and skills. IRD needed a new direction to overcome this problem.   On 1 September 1992, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) was established by legislation as a statutory board under the Ministry of Finance. With this conversion, IRAS was incorporated by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore Act to take over the functions previously performed by the Inland Revenue Department.   The conversion was to give IRAS the autonomy and flexibility to manage its personnel and financial resources. In other words, the conversion marked more than a change in name or a change in organisation. It was a change towards achieving excellence in service to the nation and its people in the area of tax administration.

The plan identified major greenway corridors as being along rivers, railway lines, and some roadway sections. (A greenway is essentially a high quality bike and pedestrian path as part of a wider network.) One of the planned greenways went along this railway line and pipeline reserve connecting the downtown area with north of Larkin, a corridor which certainly has potential as a greenway, though it would need pavement, some weather protection, a few shops installed in the residential areas, and continuity past major roadways and other obstacles. The trail is used by some locals and a pedestrian bridge over the railway was provided connecting the area to the Danga City Mall, a long-running mall which finally closed down in late 2019, unable to compete with the slew of new malls opening around the city and hampered by a lack of good connectivity to the nearby downtown and customs checkpoint. The pedestrian bridge is now barricaded off, but a shortcut pedestrian pathway still connects down to the back of the mall. The greenways plan was fairly conceptual, and needs more detailed study and planning before it can be realised. The Wadi Hana area will be transformed with the coming RTS rail link to Singapore, currently under construction. It's unknown whether this transformation will include a greenway along this path.","hint":"clinging","total_found":"11","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8334347,"code":"GC9EHBV","name":"RC-S\\16","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":1,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.289717,"longitude":103.79885,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2021-07-31","lastFoundDate":"2023-03-22","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9EHBV","description":"Deploying a series of caches for the famous Rail Corridor from the central - ie the Bukit Timah Railway Station venue.

Admittedly, it\u2019s difficult to make one of these that will remain safe in the super-clean, muggle-dense city that we live in. But, I hope I\u2019ve found the solution in the form of a Letterbox Hybrid cache. Inspired by the Taipei Beimen Post Office cache in Taiwan, this Letterbox Hybrid cache is placed in a literal letterbox in Novena. To get to the cache and the logbook, follow the instructions below: Step 1: Go to the Published Coordinates  The easiest way to get to Novena is via the North-South MRT Line. If travelling from the City, take the NSL Trains towards Jurong East and alight at Novena Station (NS20), which is about 10 minutes from City Hall. Once you get past the ticket gantry, look for the underpass to United Square, and take the escalators up to street-level. Follow your GPSr to the published coordinates. You\u2019ll find a bronze sculpture at the GZ. Search the sculpture for a film canister containing a key for the final cache. The coordinates of the final cache is N01\u00b0 19.144' E103\u00b0 50.539'.  Step 2: Search for the Letterbox  Take the key, and search for the Novena Post Office. The coordinates will bring you to the approximate area of the post office (since it\u2019s near impossible to the get accurate coordinates at the PO Box itself because the nature of its location). Once you find the Novena Post Office, look for Newton PO Box No. 183. Do not confuse this with the Balestier Road or Novena PO Boxes, which are nearby.       Open the letterbox with the key and examine its contents  Step 3: Inside the Letterbox  The initial contents of the box are:\r \t a logbook some unwritten postcards (for visitors to Singapore) some rubber stamps two containers for your trackables a pen   Sign the logbook, and feel free to use your own stamps in the logbook. There\u2019s plenty of space in the book, so you can be as creative as you want with your log. If you are exchanging TBs, be sure to write down your exchanges in the logbook. There are two containers in the letterbox for you to sort your trackables according to their intended destination. One is for trackables remaining in the Asia-Pacific Region, while the other is for the rest of the world. Once you are done, please place everything back in the letterbox neatly, and lock the Letterbox. Finally, return the key to the published coordinates and you\u2019re done!  Final Notes:  Please take good care of the key and everything in the letterbox. This cache took a lot of investment and time to set up, and it would be a shame if this has to be shut down due to bad or careless geocacher behaviour. Beware of muggles at both the published coordinates and at the letterbox. Don\u2019t act suspiciously or put the caches in jeopardy. If there are any issues with the cache, please let me know on by sending me a message on geocaching.com. My phone number is also in the logbook, in case of any questions from the post office staff. Keep everything in the PO Box neat and organised, and if there\u2019s any official mail addressed to me in the cache, please do not remove or take it.    Thank you for visiting, and I would love to hear your comments about the cache in your logs. Happy geocaching, and I hope you enjoyed your visit!

Jl. Harimau features a major concentration of clinics (many skin and orthopedic), and associated laboratories, training institutions, and shops in a 140m row of four-storey terrace buildings just to the west of the cache. A highrise hotel towers over the clinics at the top of the hill, and the clinics face onto two hectares of SAJ water towers and green space which seems out of place in such a valuable area for real estate development. (Ranhill SAJ Sdn Bhd is a privately owned water utility company incorporated in 1994 which is responsible for water supply services in Johor.) Rounding out the varied mix of land uses in this inner part of Jl. Harimau is a cluster of banks on the corner and a petrol station across the road from the cache. Unusually for the inner area, pretty much all of the buildings within a 250m radius of the cache were already built in the early 2000s, with nothing newly build in the last 20 years. One of the results is that the space around the buildings is quite porous, with pedestrian pathways past the clinics for example and into the surrounding areas. This contrasts with the highrises along Jl. Dato Abdullah Tahir to the south which are walled off from the surrounding neighbourhoods and prevent pedestrian access. The striking mix of uses in the wider Sri Tebrau area, some daytime and some night-time oriented (especially the restaurants), and the high traffic volumes here along Jalan Tebrau into downtown Johor Bahru ensure that there are usually people around at any time of the day or night, but all are just passing by except for the sometimes-curious (hence discretion is required) petrol station attendants across the road.","hint":"black","total_found":"15","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8486166,"code":"GC9KMB7","name":"The Fourteen 8000-ers - Dhaulagiri","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.3476,"longitude":103.676417,"ownerId":"PR6F3H3","ownerName":"Lionking8991","placedDate":"2021-12-26","lastFoundDate":"2023-04-28","lastFoundTime":"18:56:41","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9KMB7","description":"Fourteen \u2026\u2026 14 \u2026\u2026 \u5341\u56db \uff01 A coincidence that the number of mountains which exceed the death zone (8,000m or higher) has fourteen of them.

Are you ready to dig through some serious paperwork to find the logsheet? We hope so, because that's exactly what you'll have to do! As you approach the cache location, you'll find a pile of tax forms and laundry receipts. We know, it's not the most glamorous sight, but trust us, it's worth it. The logsheet is hidden somewhere within the mess, waiting for you to uncover it. Now, we know what you're thinking. \"Why on earth would anyone want to sift through a pile of receipts and forms?\" Well, we'll tell you why. The feeling of accomplishment you'll get when you finally find the logsheet will be worth every single paper cut and crumpled receipt. Plus, you'll get to brag to all your geocaching friends about how you conquered the challenge. And don't worry, we've made sure to mix up the pile so it's not just a bunch of boring tax forms. We've thrown in some old laundry receipts, dry cleaning bills, and even a couple of expired coupons. You never know what you'll find! Once you've located the logsheet, take a moment to bask in your glory, sign your name, and maybe even leave a fun receipt or form-related joke for the next geocacher to enjoy. Here's one to get you started: \"Why did the accountant cross the road? To get to the other side of the tax year!\" So come on down to the geocache and get ready to dive into some serious paperwork.

Buildings that draw from a particular style, but are not quite the same as the original. Here, we will meet the charming \u201cimposters\u201d of the colonial black-and-white bungalows that we are more acquainted to.  To learn more, take a short walk here to find out about the history hidden A-Monk Us!  This cache is located at Monk\u2019s Hill, named for the home of one of the residents and plantation owners of the Orchard area who lived here in the 1860s. In the 1920s, two rows of townhouses were built on Monk\u2019s Hill Terrace as Government Subordinate Quarters or homes for civil servants. These, of course, are in contrast to the stately bungalows built for the higher ranked officers in the leafy estates that we are more familiar with. Nevertheless, they retain that iconic black-and-white style with various architectural elements drawn from Malay kampung houses such as large windows and balconies, suited for living in the tropical heat.   However, these buildings aren\u2019t even the oddest buildings on Monk\u2019s Hill. Just down the road, on Monk\u2019s Hill Road, are 5 black-and-white SIT (Singapore Improvement Trust) flats, which were the predecessors to the ubiquitous HDB flats of today. These early examples of public housing, built in the 1950s, also retained architectural elements for the colonial residences there were based on, and were among the tallest residential blocks in Singapore at the time. Today, they still bear the iconic black-and white blinds, and paintwork on their facades. Indeed, they may look like the bungalows and townhouses of an earlier era, but they are modern \u201cimposters\u201d. However, let\u2019s not let that diminish their charm as they are still pieces of architectural heritage in their own right.  Today, this quiet neighbourhood with its narrow streets seems stuck in time, though a stone\u2019s throw away from the modern skyscrapers along Scotts and Orchard Roads and the bustling (in)famous Newton Food Centre. Many of the homes here still function as residences which can be rented, though they will cost a pretty penny these days.  As for the cache, well\u2026 experienced cachers will know how to spot this rather sus guy in a heartbeat. For those new to the game, do check out the hint.

Don\u2019t worry too much if you\u2019re not a nerd; you won\u2019t need a deep working understanding of Physics to solve the puzzles. As always, the cache is not at the published coordinates but here you\u2019ll find a location which is named for a place related to the theme of this puzzle. Background If you have used a GPS (and as geocachers, you most definitely have!), you should already know that our coordinates are specified by an ordered pair of digits we call longitude (East\/West) and latitude (North\/South. These uniquely specify a location on the surface of a sphere i.e. the Earth. They are typically expressed as a pair of angles, in degrees, minutes and\/or seconds.      The latitude is defined as the angle north or south of an imaginary line called the Equator, which is defined as the set of points on the surface situated 90 degrees from the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation, or the geographic North and South Poles. The location of the Equator, and thus how we define the angle of latitude is mostly unambiguous and non-arbitrary, since the axis of rotation remains (mostly) static for our intents and purposes. Consequently, by measuring the angle of the sun and other \u201cfixed\u201d celestial bodies in the sky, we can measure latitude to a decent degree of precision with nothing more than a sextant before the advent of satellites and GPS. The difficulty arises in our determination of Longitude, and, this problem came to be known as the Longitude Problem. The reason why longitude was so hard to determine came down to two main problems:  agreeing on the location of the reference line that would become the Prime Meridian, which is the \u201czero longitude\u201d where the longitude angle was to be measured east or west from determining one\u2019s position east\/west from the Prime Meridian based on local observations at the point of measurement, which turns out to be linked to our ability to accurately keep time over a long period, something we take for granted today.  The science, history, and corresponding inventions that came to be in our quest to solve the Longitude Problem is long and fascinating, and I will leave the details to you to research for yourself. What\u2019s important is where we have found ourselves today \u2013 and that is with the Prime Meridian located at the Greenwich Observatory in London which has become the basis for the measurement of time and space on Earth today.    Indeed, with the Prime Meridian set in London, all statements of Longitude are nothing but increasingly precise measurements of the angle of a location from the line of Longitude where the Greenwich Observatory is located. What\u2019s more, how we have defined our time zones follow suit, with the local time at all locations on Earth calculated based on the time differences from the Greenwich Mean Time (or GMT), which is the time set at that same eponymous observatory. And so, for the last century, we have literally been determining where we are in \u201cspace\u201d we are and what time it is now based on the standards set in one special location almost halfway around the world. With all that said, why not dive deeper into this aspect of Time and Space by spending some prime time to solve this puzzle so that you can log a cache located near some prime real estate space?

Located along Wolskel Road in a private estate, this beautiful little white house was built by Mr Bryan Lim in 2014, drawing inspiration from the LFLs he saw in the U.S. If you're lucky, you may even bump into him at GZ!

The cache is not at the published coordinates, as you need to crack the code below to figure out where the cache is hidden. Some Historic Background This cache is a nod to the history of the area. This place was once RAF Chia Keng, a British Royal Air Force Military Base which served as a base for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Singapore. The GCHQ started off as the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), which, as the name suggests, specialised in cryptography and code-breaking, and included feats like breaking the Enigma Cipher during World War II at Bletchley Park.   The GCHQ\u2019s first listening station for the Far East was located here at RAF Chia Keng, and one can only wonder about what top secret communiques were picked up by the aerial masts that once stood tall in the vicinity. And so, in the spirit of the history of the place, it is only apt that a cryptic puzzle be placed here to challenge you. The Simple Substitution Cipher Substitution ciphers are probably the oldest form of cryptography, simply because the idea behind it is well\u2026 simple. Every letter in the alphabet undergoes a one-to-one substitution with another letter, thus obscuring the message by means of a \u201cfunction\u201d known only to the sender and the receiver. The substitution function or key is fixed throughout the entire encoding process, which is in contrast to more complex ciphers, like the polyalphabetic cipher, where each letter can be enciphered to various other letters depending on its position in the plaintext and another secret keyword.   Of course, the simplicity of the cipher also means that it is easily broken through various means. The most well-known illustration of how substitution ciphers can be broken \"by hand\" was deftly written as a plot point in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s \u201cThe Adventure of the Dancing Men\u201d, in which Sherlock Holmes used a number of classic methods to crack the code. These methods were frequency analysis (i.e. using the frequency of common letters in words of a language), and the use of common bigrams and trigrams (i.e. two letter or three-letter sets that frequently appear in a language). However, the difficulty of a code using the substitution cipher could be increased by chunking the letters into regular blocks (usually of 5 letters) to obscure the presence of short and common one, two or three letter blocks in a text (e.g. \"an\", \"the\", \"to\" and the like) hence making it a little harder to identify these blocks. But, which a sharp eye and nowadays, using computers and programmes, the frequency of letters and N-grams can still easily be tabulated in spite of this. Adding in algorithm that uses a dictionary attack and scanning the resulting plaintext for recognisable words further hastens the rate at which these codes can be broken. Cracking substitution ciphers can be still further \u201ccomplicated\u201d by adding in deliberate misspellings in the plain text and the use of the other languages to throw off such programmes that are built to function in a particular language, but even then, with enough perseverance, a large enough dataset and some good observational skills, the combination of a human and computer scanning through the possibilities should be able to crack the vast majority of substitution ciphers. With all that said, why not try your hand at this puzzle and see if you can really crack my \u201csimple\u201d substitution cipher?   The Puzzle Before we begin, let me outline a few key parameters that are absolutely true about the substitution cipher key I am using for this puzzle.  The plaintext is indeed in English. In fact, I am going to further divulge that it is in Standard British English. This is a \u201csimple\u201d substitution cipher, that is, every character in the ciphertext decodes to exactly one and the same character in the plaintext throughout the whole message. There are no other types of ciphers used, that is, no transposition (i.e. scrambling of the letter positions), polygraphic (i.e. one plaintext character represented by more than one ciphertext character) or polyalphabetic (i.e. any character being possibly encoded to all other characters) cipher shenanigans going on in this puzzle. There is, however, a non-cryptographic additional \u201clayer\u201d in the puzzle which you need to figure out, and it is not because I deliberately misspelt any of the plaintext words.    To make things even simpler, I will even give you two pangrams (i.e. sentences that contains all the letters of the English alphabet) and their corresponding ciphertexts encoded using my substitution cipher. This would render cracking most substitution ciphers trivial, as I hope it would for you in this case, too (see, I am not all that evil).

The published coordinates provide a good starting point to begin your hunt, but there is no physical cache hidden here. The whole walk and hunt should take no more than 30 minutes, even at the most leisurely pace.   Introduction to Emerald Hill  Tired of the crowds of Orchard Road? Bored of all that ultra-modern glass and steel architecture? Craving a little walk down memory lane? Well, there\u2019s this little hidden corner of the Orchard District known as Emerald Hill, where you can see how the area looked like before the glitz took over. Before all the urban development you see today, Orchard Road was once filled with orchards (what else?). The area that is now Emerald Hill was once part of William Cuppage\u2019s nutmeg plantation. In the early 20th Century, with the area becoming more desirable as a residential area, being in a pleasant leafy area just outside the city, the former plantation land was subdivided, sold off and redeveloped into an upscale residential area. Indeed, much of the land around Orchard Road saw the same redevelopment, greatly improving the prestige of the area as the choice residential area for the affluent and prominent members of Singapore\u2019s colonial society. The land on Emerald Hill was bought over by prominent Peranakan Chinese (Chinese immigrants who intermarried and assimilated with the local Straits culture). These developers were keen to both show off their wealth and their unique cultures. Thus, they built rows of double-storied terrace houses in what is now known as the Straits Eclectic Style, an architectural style found nowhere else outside the Straits Settlements. Combining components of traditional Malay houses, European architecture and Chinese icons, the houses are a beautiful convergence of the cultures that define Singapore. As you walk up Emerald Hill, note the various elements of the Straits Eclectic Style: the pintu pagar (half doors outside the main door to allow ventilation within the house while still maintaining privacy), the European half-columns and the Chinese-inspired reliefs of phoenixes, bats and flowers. While most of the other parts of the Orchard District has been redeveloped in the late 20th century, somehow, Emerald Hill\u2019s heritage buildings remained intact and, in fact, have been faithfully restored to their original splendour. Truly, the Hill is a hidden architectural gem.   The Cache While you enjoy the quaint neighbourhood, I\u2019m sure you want do a little caching on the side. Well, it\u2019s your lucky day, there is indeed a cache to find here! But, first, some legwork is required. The published coordinates will bring you to the vicinity of 6 Emerald Hill Road, where you\u2019ll find a plaque describing the history of the building here. As you walk up the road, there are 5 other similar plaques. Gather the following information from each plaque to calculate the final cache coordinates: 6 Emerald Hill Road:  The digit sum of the year the building here was built = X 41 Emerald Hill Road: The digit sum of the year the photo was taken = A, and the digit sum of the year the building was designed = B 45 Emerald Hill Road: The digit sum of the year the photo was taken = C, and the digit sum of the year the building was designed = D 66 Emerald Hill Road: The digit sum of the year the photo was taken = E, and the digit sum of the year the building was developed = F 74 Emerald Hill Road: The digit sum of the year the photo was taken = G 77 Emerald Hill Road The digit sum of the year the photo was taken = Y Hint: The digit sum is the summation of the 4 digits of the year e.g. the digit sum of 2018 is 2 + 0 + 1 + 8 = 11  Final coordinates can be obtained from the following formula: N001 18.

The drain is more of a tight fit but you should be able make it through without touching the walls or the roof. I will give you an extra hint just because there wont be much satellite recption in the drain. There is a large drain and a smaller corridor. Take the smaller corridor and follow it down past three pipes on your right. At the third, look around. Once you get there it should be an easy find, it's just getting there that is the hard part.

I was always curious why this patch of wooded prime real estate opposite the Concorde Hotel was left vacant. Perhaps it\u2019s too narrow for any viable commercial building or that it\u2019s too close to the Istana\u2026 or maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s a secret hiding underground\u2026 Conspiracies aside, what\u2019s more surprising is that this patch of green wasn\u2019t always vacant. In fact, some might say, that the previous residents were going around in circles, went postal and left the place to the dogs. Do you know why?  Clemenceau Avenue, which is now split into two (a North portion at Cairnhill, and a South portion at Fort Canning), used to intersect this part of Orchard Road. The central portion of the Avenue was expunged when the Central Expressway (CTE) was built. The intersection between the two roads was known as the Orchard Circus, with a fifth small exit leading to the Istana gates. The Circus has now been completely wiped off the map, with nary a trace that a roundabout once stood here.   At the southwestern corner of Orchard Circus stood two buildings: the old Orchard Post Office and the Headquarters of the Society of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals or the SPCA. The Orchard Post Office building was built in 1902, but the building proved too cramped to serve the needs of the quickly developing Orchard area, so the post office was moved to the Killiney Post Office just down the road. Next door to the Post Office was the SPCA. There were kennels there as early as 1954, but the main building which became the headquarters were completed in 1965. The site was occupied until the general area was slated for redevelopment in the 1980s, so all the buildings there, along with the roundabout disappeared, leaving us with a curious green patch in between Orchard and Penang Roads.  Today, other than a carpark and clump of trees that seem to be surprisingly wilder than one would expect in central Singapore, there really isn\u2019t anything else here. Well, now there\u2019s a cache that I hope you\u2019ll find somewhat amusing. It is hidden in plane sight, as you\u2019ll see, but please be gentle! There is no need to remove the host, just remove and replace the \u201cpayload\u201d when logging the cache.

He always bought these puffs from the more popular outlet at the time, the one that ultimateiy did not become the widely franchised brand.

The temple is dedicated to Kali, the goddess of Time, Change, Power, Creation, Preservation, and Destruction, and is thought to be one of the first temples in Singapore devoted to her. Its original name was Soonambu Kambam Kovil, or \"Temple at the Village of Lime\", a reference to the lime kilns where many of its builders were employed. The temple quickly became an important landmark and symbol for the community in the mid-19th century, not just a place of worship, but a reminder of home. Over the years, the temple expanded, with significant additions in 1908, when statues of Kali and the major Hindu deities were installed. By this time, there was daily worship at the temple, in addition to other social and cultural activities. The income generated from temple services and collections became sufficient to engage a full-time priest, and further expansion occurred throughout the first half of the twentieth century. During World War II, the temple was used as an air-raid shelter, and (fortunately) suffered no major damage. Restoration of the temple to its current state began in 1983, including the installation of the current gopuram, eight main Domes and several other minor ones.

Quick History Extracted from Infopedia as usual   New World Park was the first of three amusement parks (or the three \"worlds\") that wooed Singapore night crowds from the 1920s to the 1960s.  Set up in 1923 and located at Jalan Besar, it closed down in 1987.  Today, the site where the park sat is being developed by City Developments for its City Square project, comprising a public park, a condominium, a large shopping mall. The park, which is to be completed in 2009, will feature the original gate to the former New World Park.    In 1923, Ong Boon Tat and Ong Peng Hock set up New World Park, the first of the three amusement parks that coloured Singapore's night life from the 1920s to the 1960s. New World was located at Jalan Besar, bounded by Serangoon Road, Kitchener Road and Whampoa River.  The park was sold to Shaw Brothers which acquired a 50-percent interest.   During the Japanese Occupation, New World was renamed Shin Segal and turned into a gambling farm opened only to civilians but not Japanese soldiers.    New World closed in 1987 when Shaw Organisation sold the freehold site to City Developments. Work to build a condominium and an eight-storey mall on the site was planned to start in late 2004.   New World was famous for its cabarets, Chinese and Malay opera halls, shops, restaurants, open-air cinemas, boxing arenas, and shooting galleries. When the park first opened, the Ong brothers hired travelling vaudeville-style troupes from China as a regular draw.  New World's cabarets were so raved about that it was said to have occasionally wooed the late Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and his large entourage. Men would pay a dollar to dance three foxtrots or waltzes with cheogsam-clad taxi-dancers. New World was also the place where Sakura Teng, a well-known 1970s Malaysian songbird, launched her music career at age 17.    Malay men were drawn to New World by Bunga Tanjong which hosted bands playing Malay tunes to the beat of ronggeng  or asli  interspersed with cha-cha or rumba. On some nights, they would also threw in the twist and the rock 'n roll. Men could buy a 50 cent ticket for a dance with the ladies. The early birds would secure the best dancers or their favourite ones and also got seats nearest to the dancing girls.  On some nights Bunga Tanjong could pack up to 500 people. The popularity of Bunga Tanjong inspired acclaimed playwright A.Samad Said to write a well-received play on the life of a cabaret girl, entitled Lantai T. Pinkie (T. Pinkie's floor).    Four artistes or athletes were household names in New World; striptease queen Rose Chan, wrestler King Kong, strongman Ali Ahmad (better known as Mat Tarzan) and boxer Felix Boy. Rose Chan and King Kong were controversial for their stunts; the former wrestled pythons during her shows while the latter, a Hungarian-born giant whose real name was Emile Czaya, once ate a whole goat to promote his fight.   New World faded from the night scene after the 1960s, a fate that affected the other two \"worlds\" - Great World and Gay World.  In April 1987, City Developments bought New World's 42,252.1 sq m site from Shaw Organisation for S$35 million.  The major development on this site is the City Square Residences condominium.

Solve the puzzle below to get the true coordinates for the cache.  One of the great tragedies of living on an island with very limited space is that locations of significant historical and cultural value can get lost in the madness of rapid development. Fortunately, thanks to some foresight, a few of these places have been preserved for future generations to help remember their cultural and historical roots. I have been visiting a few of the lesser-known ones over the past year, and I thought I'd share some of them with you.   In this puzzle, your task is to first put the pieces of the past back together.

In the early years of the 1900s, the first railway line across Singapore was constructed with Tank Road as the southern terminus. The Tank Road Station opened in 1903, and trains leaving the station would continue north towards Newton, and run parallel to Bukit Timah Road and Woodlands Road towards Kranji. Before the construction of the Causeway, passengers will then take a ferry to Johor and continue northwards on the Peninsular from there. The railway line was further extended south to pass through Pulau Saigon, Tanjong Pagar with its terminus at Borneo Wharf in 1907. When the railway line was realigned to the new route (which is now the Green Corridor) passing through Buona Vista, the Tank Road line was dismantled. The Tank Road Station was demolished in 1933 after the new Southern Terminal along Keppel Road began its operation. The former site of the railway station is now the green space that lies between Clemenceau Avenue and Tank Road. Along Tank Road today stands a few prominent buildings that have been in the area from about the same period as the train station. The published coordinates will bring you to one of these buildings.

The root of the conflict stemmed from Indonesia's opposition to the formation of the new country of Malaysia which included Peninsular Malaya, Singapore and the previously British held regions of the island of Borneo. Indonesia, under the lead of President Sukarno, attempted to destabilise Malaysia through a series of military infiltrations through the land and sea borders between the two countries. Most of the fighting was seen at the border regions between Indonesian Kalimantan and the state of Sarawak in East Malaysia, but Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore was not spared from any conflict. Raids were sent across the Straits of Malacca from the Indonesian island of Sumatra into the Malaysian state of Johor, while a series of terrorist acts were attempted in Singapore. The most serious incident related to the Konfrontasi in Singapore involved the bombing of MacDonald House, once home to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation offices. The bomb led to injuries and a few fatalities of the bank staff members, and the incident became a symbol of the brutality and dangers faced by both military personnel and civilians during the Konfrontasi period in Singapore. The memorial is located in Dhoby Ghaut Green, across Orchard Road from MacDonald House, and tells the tale of the sacrifices made by Singaporeans to protect the young nation during this brutal period. The memorial commemorates the 50th anniversary of the bombing.

The cache is located just off and out of sight from where all the crowds congregate for their photo opportunities, so you shouldn't have to worry about having too many eyes trained on you while you are searching for this cache. After finding the cache, you can decide whether you want to join in the hype, or take a quiet walk through Fort Canning.  It is remarkable how the social media has changed the places we choose to visit when we are out and about. Just a decade ago, this serene spiral staircase in Singapore was virtually unknown to the masses, overshadowed by the big ticket attractions like the Singapore Flyer and Sentosa or iconic landmarks, like the Merlion. Back in a time when place recognition was controlled by the tour companies and the tourism board, no one thought that the tree tunnel was worth visiting. After all, it had nothing any tourist attraction would have: no history, no panoramas, no natural sights, no concession stands, no rides, nothing. It was just a piece of public infrastructure in a pretty place. In fact, I had known about this tunnel since 2007 at the very least, and barely no one visits the place back then, even on the weekends.     So, imagine my bemusement when the spot suddenly started popping up on lists of IG-worthy places in Singapore. At some point in the last few years, more and more people had started to discover this place. Indeed, for the longest time, NParks never did signpost the existence of the \"Tree Tunnel\" around the park, but in their latest set of signs and maps, the Tree Tunnel started to make its appearance. I could only guess that this was in response to increasing number of questions about where this \"mysterious\" location was. I can still remember vividly walking in Fort Canning one day a couple of years back and being stopped by a lost tourist looking for this very place, so I guess NParks had gone through the same thing. For better or for worse, the geo-tags on social media have catapulted this and other insignificant but very photogenic places from obscurity to overnight fame. From the Blue Boathouse in Perth, to #thatwanakatree in New Zealand, many places around the world have become well-known simply by the multitude of photographs taken from the location. These have real-life implications on these locales - the quiet lakeside town of Wanaka is now a major tourist stop because of the tree, and city authorities had to construct a brand new toilet near the boathouse because of the increased number of tourists who walk all the way out to the spot just for the photo.  There are also horror stories of people trespassing into private land and increased weathering of natural sites in the US because of previously unknown places becoming tourist hotspots virtually overnight. As with all things to do with society and technology, it is a double-edged sword, and one that we will increasingly observe.  You can see the hype for yourself here through how a quiet spot in a city became a tourist sensation overnight. Even during this time of social distancing, people still risk coming here to take that perfect shot. You have a choice, of course, as to whether you want to join them and participate in the hype. No matter what you choose to do, the place is undeniably beautiful, especially at certain times of the day. But, perhaps you might to put your phone camera away for once, and just enjoy the spot for what it is?

This batch of geocaches will guide you to some of the highlights of this fascinating town-within-a-town.  The published coordinates will bring you to the front of Abdul Gafoor Mosque. This beautiful complex was built in the first decade of the 1900s to replace the old al-Abrar Mosque that used to stand at this site.The mosque served the Indian Muslim community of the Kampong Kapor area, many of whom worked at the racecourse that was at nearby Farrer Park. It is named after Shaik Abdul Gafoor bin Shaik Hyder, a clerk in the law firm Khory and Brydges, and an important fundraiser for the construction of the building. The mosque itself is architecturally unique in Singapore, with unusual symmetry, and elements of Saracenic, Roman, and Moorish designs -- there are both Western elements (stained glass), and classic Islamic features (Arabic calligraphy) in the interior of the prayer hall. To gather the information to find the cache, take a walk inside the complex, find where the pictures were taken, and answer the following questions about the censored areas: A: How many points on the star?  B: How many red triangles on the pillar?  C: How many cornices on each wall section?  D: How many small circles on each glass floor panel (hint: it's a 3-digit number)?  Once you have gathered all this information, go search for the cache at N 1 18.[(D\/4) + 3A + B + C], E 103 51.[(D\/4) + A + B + 4C]   The cache is a camouflaged micro container. The high D rating for this multi reflects the difficulty of the final hide, and that we do expect some DNFs. Accordingly, please do not post spoilers in your log. Note that while the mosque is open and the cache available 24\/7, you should be avoid gathering the clues if prayers are being said, and of course be respectful at all other times.

The reason for having paper towns in maps is to catch others who attempt to plagiarise the map of the original publisher. Therefore, when drawing out maps, cartographers often add non-existent streets, buildings or towns (the so-called \"paper towns\"). If other people copy the maps wholesale, they would then inadvertently copy the ficiticious places into their own maps. The original publisher looks for these paper towns in other maps. If they exist, it is then obvious that the other maps has been copied from his original map, and he thus has proof to lodge a complaint against the plagiariser. The identities of paper towns are closely guarded secrets, and often only revealed decades after the original maps were published as users start to notice the discrepancy between the maps and the reality, by which time, the maps have become obsolete and new paper towns have been added. This puzzle is not about such paper towns per se. However, it does have a lot to do with paper and town maps and of course, in line with the entire spirit of having \"paper towns\" in maps: BE WARNED, there are decoys and traps in the puzzle. The Puzzle Hey! I just heard from Margo's parents that she has ran away from home again. Looks like it's time for another road trip to search for her. I expected her to have left some clues in her room as she always does when she disappears, but there wasn't any. But, today... there was finally a bit of a lead. Before she left, Margo sent a letter to herself, and it arrived in the mail today. Her parents let me have the letter, since we managed to solve her puzzles the last time she ran away. As usual, its going to be quite a bit of work piecing all her little clues together, so here we go again... OK, in the envelope were two sheets of paper. The first is just 6 rows of seemingly random numbers: 1 0 3 5 1 6 7 0 1 4 6 2 5 3 0 1 1 6 4 1 6 6 3 4 1 2 4 5 4 8 3 2 8 9 7 9 9 9 0 8 9 3 1 8 0 9 9 9 7 1 6 6 1 5 0 5 0 7 2 8 2 2 5 9 3 1 2 6 9 7 2 4 2 6 2 5 9 1 9 0 2 3 9 8 8 7 1 4 9 1 1 4 9 2 4 3 The second is quite a bit more intruiging. Margo has been doing quite a bit of arts and craft and it looks like she has been poring through the Street Directories from ages ago. She cut out small maps of 8 different locations across Singapore and glued them to another page. Here it is:  Could they be the places she plans to run away to? Or, maybe there is more to the puzzle than that? There's plenty of information to take in at the moment, so I could really use your help to sort it out. Let me know when you think you've managed to figure out where Margo has gone to. Thanks so much for your help!

While the museum has expanded over the years, the distinct fish-scale tiled rotunda has been an iconic feature of the building, greeting visitors as they enter the stately entrance atrium, and begin their journey through Singapore's history.   Act 1: The Beginnings of a Collection  The collection here had its humble beginnings as the Raffles Library and Museum, as an attempt by the colonial authorities to establish a natural history and ethnographical collection representing the region. The collection began in earnest in 1849 with the donation of two gold coins by the Temenggong of Johor, and steadily grew over the years, through the work of naturalists who scoured the region for new species. The collection moved several times in its early years, first located at the school that would soon be known as Raffles Institution, and later at the Town Hall (today's Victoria Concert Hall), and then back into the Institution.  It was then that the idea of a dedicated building to house the large collection was proposed, and Colonial Engineer Henry E. McCallum designed the iconic front section of the musuem we see today. The design was simplified somewhat by John F. A. McNair, and the first part of the building, with the rotunda was completed and opened in 1887.   The Museum in the 1890s (before the extensions) As the collection grew, two more wings were added behind the original front block - the parallel annex was first added in 1907 to house the zoological collection, and another wing in 1916 to expand the library. The annexes were cleverly designed to mimic the exact style of the original block, so much so that until today, it's hard to tell that they were later additions.    Act 2: The Parting of the Ways  The Museum in the 1920s (after the first extensions) Over the decades, the Raffles Museum collection become the most prominent collection of natural history artifacts in the region, and as space grew scarce, the Library's collection was transferred to the newly established National Library building next door in 1960, and the Museum was renamed the National Museum.  The next major change was to come in 1972, when the government decided that Museum was to shift its focus to documenting the history of the new nation of Singapore. The zoological and natural history collection was scattered through the region, with part of the collection kept by the National University of Singapore (where it later formed the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity, and its successor, the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum). The rest was sold to Malaysia and India, among other places. The National Museum's Famous Whale Skeleton (which has now been lost)   The building was gazetted as a National Monument in 1992, and changed its name to the National History Museum in 1993. One final major change took place between 2003 and 2006, when the museum closed down for major renovations, which saw the addition of the modern annex behind the original one. The Museum reopened in 2006 and took on its current name, The National Museum of Singapore.  Act 3: The Museum Today Today, the museum is home to the Permanent History Gallery, which is housed in the modern annex, Temporary Exhibitions which is also housed in the modern annex, and a set of smaller galleries in the original building, each representing a specific aspect of Singaporean society and culture. The museum also houses several outdoor artworks and exhibitions, such as the Singapore Night Festival, usually on its front lawn. Admission to the Permanent History Galleries are free for Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents, though there is an admission fee for the Temporary Exhibitions.  Even without visiting the galleries, the architecture of the building is a sight to behold. From the aforementioned entrance atrium under the rotunda, try to find the mysterious spiral staircase that is rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of a former curator. You can also cross the glass passage between the old and new annexes and see the rotunda tower over the glass ceiling, or enjoy the musical show and projections in the \"second rotunda\" that marks the entrance to the History Gallery.  And Finally...  Yes... about the cache. You will find it outside the museum, accessible 24\/7 with ample parking at Fort Canning Park. The cache itself shouldn't be too hard to spot, there really isn't many places to hide something at the coordinates. But, you'll find getting the cache out of its hide a bit of a puzzle. Check the hints if you are stuck... though you'll still need a bit of creativity on site to figure out a solution, or fashion\/bring the right tool.

I hope you\u2019ll find this cache a fun way to uncover a \u201cspookier\u201d side of the museum, while gaining a smiley at the end of it all. NOTE: Both locals and tourists NEED NOT PAY an admission fee to access the location required to complete the cache, though you will need to visit the museum during its opening hours. You will need to complete the task described in this listing to claim the find, and logs that do not fulfill the requirement will be deleted. Without further ado, let\u2019s get into the story behind your task! What are Virtual Caches? Unlike the conventional caches, Virtual Caches do not require the geocacher to find a physical container at the coordinates. Instead, to claim a \u201cfind\u201d, cachers need to prove that they have visited the location at the coordinates by completing a set of tasks set up by the cache owner. Unfortunately, new Virtual Caches can no longer be created, except for special Virtual Caches that have been given out as rewards over the last few years. Pre-existing Virtual Caches have been grandfathered and are allowed to be listed as long as the cache is still viable. The identifying symbol for a Virtual Cache is a rather cute ghost, and I like to think that it kind of represents a sort of non-physical cache container \u201chaunting\u201d a particular spot for all eternity. And in that spirit (pun very much intended), this virtual cache is about the (in)famous Ghost of the National Museum. Where Got Ghost?  At the coordinates, up on the second floor of the iconic rotunda atrium of the National Museum, is a wrought iron spiral staircase. While these beautiful pieces of architecture are typical of the Neo-Palladian style in which the Museum is built in, this special staircase has managed to gain notoriety as the most haunted part of the museum. If the tales are to be believed, visitors have reported feeling cold spots near the staircase. Furthermore, cleaners and some (un)fortunate visitors have also reported seeing an entity walk up and down the spiral staircase. Who it is or why an entity haunts the staircase is a dark and murky question\u2026 some say it\u2019s the ghost of one of the museum\u2019s former directors and accomplished biologist, Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill, who was said to have died by suicide just days before he was due to relinquish his post at the museum. Others believe that it has something to do with the exhibits that were stored in the room at the top the stairs in what is perhaps, a classic case of a cursed artifact. Those who peddle this version of events claim that some shrunken heads from the headhunters of Borneo used to be kept up there, or perhaps, these were some items taken wrongfully from a powerful local bomoh (Malay shaman or medicine man). Whichever tale you want to believe (or not), do pay a visit to these stairs on your visit to the Museum. When you find them, complete the following task: Bring a \u201cghost\u201d to the stairs and take a photo of your \u201cghost\u201d with the spiral stairs in the background. Upload your photo(s) with your \u201cFound\u201d log. Logs without the photo will be deleted. Additional notes: You may choose to use any image or form of a ghost you prefer. You could print out a picture of a ghost, print a cutout of the Virtual Cache logo, bring your own \u201cghostly\u201d figurine or even just sketch out a \u201cghost\u201d on a piece of paper on the spot. If you\u2019re feeling extra creative, you could dress yourself or a partner up as a ghost for the photo, or even try to snap a photo of the actual(!) ghost. However, no edited or altered photos are allowed for obvious reasons. Example:  I look forward to your visits and your photos, and of course, if you do encounter anything\u2026 err\u2026 odd while you are there, please report it in your logs as well. Finally, if there\u2019s something strange in the neighbourhood, who do you call? Additional Information for Visitors     Opening hours: 10 am \u2013 7 pm, daily Closest MRT stations: Dhoby Ghaut (North-South Line, Circle Line, North-East Line), Bras Basah (Circle Line) and Bencoolen (Downtown Line) You may enter the museum from the front entrance, facing Stamford Road, or from the back entrance, facing Fort Canning Park. No admission fees are charged for entering the museum building, you need only purchase a ticket if you intend to visit any of the exhibition galleries.

While his men was clearing the land, a majestic beast appears, and catches his attention. His men claimed that it was a lion (or singa), and thus, he named the city Singapura, or the Lion City. The original Malay text of the Sejarah Melayu (the Malay Annals) is reproduced below:  \"...melintas seekor binatang maha tangkas lakunya, merah warna bulu tubuhnya, kehitam-hitaman kepalanya, dan putih dadanya; sikapnya terlalu perkasa, besar sedikit daripada kambing randuk. Setelah ia melihat orang banyak itu. lalu ia melompat, ghaib daripada mereka itu. Maka titah Seri Teri Buana,\"Apa nama binatang yang serupa itu?\" Maka seorang pun tiada menyahut. Maka sembah Demang Lebar Daun, \"Tuanku, ceritera orang patik dengar, yang demikian sifat dan kelakuan binatang itu, singa konon namanya, tuanku. \"Maka titah baginda, \"Patutlah kita perbuat negeri tempat ini, kerana binatang gagah ada di dalamnya; dan sebutlah Temasek ini Singapura!\"  The setting for many of the subsequent stories in the Sejarah Melayu can be found here on the slopes of what is today Fort Canning Park as the hill is the literal and legendary cradle of Singapura. Explore the paths of what was once known as Bukit Larangan (the Forbidden Hill), a place where no common folk would dare thread for fear of offending the royalty, to learn about the legends of 14th Century Singapore. You'll see where ancient kings bathed in a sacred spring and stand at the spot where a local strongman named Badang allegedly lifted and tossed a rock towards the mouth of the Singapore River. This cache is located on a terrace known as the Walk of the Five Kings. Here, with the aid of interpretive boards, you can learn about the mythological and historical origins of the first settlement of Singapore from the stories of the original five Malay Rulers of the island while enjoying a view of the modern city from the shaded slopes of the hill.  There is a set of escalators leading up from Fort Canning MRT station through Jubilee Park that you can use to ascend to the terrace (a luxury not afforded to old Kings of yore). Or, if you feel like you could use a bit of exercise, there are many paths leading up the side of the hill from either Hill Street, River Valley Road or Clemenceau Avenue.

The key to unlocking the mysteries of the past lies in stratigraphy and here, you will learn how soil and rocks reveal what Fort Canning Hill looked like from the 14th to the 20th century.  Fort Canning Hill  Early Sketch of Singapore, with Fort Canning Hill in the background\r   This hill, situated in the Singapore River valley, is the cradle of Singapore and the geographical heart of its history.  The hill goes by many names: Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill), Panchor (Hill of the Water Spring), Government Hill and most recently, Fort Canning Hill. It has also been the site of many stories, both real and mythical and ranging from the tragic to the truly intriguing. From the tale of Badang, the strongman who threw a rock from here to the Singapore River, to the tense final days before the Fall of Singapore in 1942, Fort Canning Hill has played a central role in Singapore\u2019s history through the centuries. Above them all, however, was the secrets it held beneath its soil that drastically changed our view of Singapore before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles. \r Prior to 1984, most historians believed Singapore (previously known also as Temasek) was nothing more than a quiet fishing village before the British arrived. In 1984, an archaeological dig headed by Dr. John Miksic on the slopes of the hill near the Keramat Sultan Iskandar Shah uncovered a huge surprise that would reshape our perspective of Singapore\u2019s past. Pottery shards and coins from the 14th century were found in the soil, with a mix of Chinese porcelain ceramics and earthenware of Southeast Asian origin, indicating that Singapore was already a busy trading port before the British arrived. The varied origin of the artefacts means that traders from throughout the region were once converging on Singapore.  Dr. Miksic's excavation revealed an interesting past of this part of the hill. The area you were currently at is believed to be an artisan's work area, where foundries and potters worked. These industries required use of fire and wood, and these activities have left an indelible mark in the earth from this era. After this particularly industrious period, the activities on site ceased for a few centuries, until the Colonial era, when the hill was repurposed for military use as Fort Canning. The question now is: how did Dr. Miksic and his team deduced the history of the site, and figured out where and when the artefacts came from? The key to the answer was how deep the artefact was found during the excavation, we know this from the study of soil layers, known as stratigraphy. Stratigraphy\r The study of soil and rock layers is known as stratigraphy, which derives its name from strata, the Latin word for \u201clayers\u201d. Over time, rocks and soil form different layers with different colours and characteristics. There are several reasons for this change in the characteristics. Long term effects come from change in climate or physical geography, like a lake drying up or the climate becoming increasingly warmer. Shorter term effects, like those seen here in the excavation site, come from change in land use or human disturbances.\r  \r Whatever the cause may be; the change in the soil and rock layers holds an important indication of the duration and nature of these changes. More importantly for archaeology, objects found in the strata can be confidently traced back to the historical period that the stratum was formed. For instance, finding a coin in a 14th century stratum would be a good reason to believe that the coin was buried in the soil during the 14thcentury and not a collectors\u2019 item lost or buried in the colonial era. \r The key principle underlying the study of stratigraphy is known as the Principle of Superposition. Its statement is fairly intuitive: older strata will be deeper than younger strata, meaning that the deeper one digs into the ground, the older the progressive layers. This is based on the fairly simple reasoning that new soil tends to be deposited over older soil\/rock. \r Finally, the transition between strata also holds an important clue. Sharp, distinct transitions between strata indicate changes in the land use over short periods of time and that there has been little activity or disturbances during the transition. Less distinct transitions indicate a more gradual change or a sign of much disturbance to soil over a period of time. \r Together, the characteristics of the soil can reveal much about the history of an area, and this information was used well by Dr. Miksic and his team in figuring out what actually happened on Fort Canning in the past and this is the object of your exploration in this Earthcache.\r The Tasks\r The tasks for this cache are fairly simple. The coordinates will bring you to the Archeological Site where you will need to \u2018unearth\u2019 the answers to the Earthcache. This is a tourist friendly Earthcache, so no extra research is required, as all the answers can be found in situ.  Questions to answer:  Describe the different strata seen at the dig site. There should be four (conveniently labelled with the numerals 1 \u2013 4).  What does the sharp and distinct boundary between the Strata 2 and 3 tell us about the land use (or lack thereof) at Fort Canning between the 14th and 19th century?  What does the colour of Layer 3 tell us about the land use at Fort Canning during the period corresponding to this layer?  Why were no artifacts found in Layer 4?

Unfortunately, the older cache was archived due to the redevelopment of Juronlg Lake Gardens. The published coordinates will bring you to a Fort Canning Park, where you will find rocks lining the sides of the paths which demonstrate this phenomenon. Weathering  The breaking down of rocks, or weathering, is defined as the process by which larger rocks and minerals are reduced to sediment and soil via natural processes, such as chemical reactions and atmospheric processes. Weathering is a distinct process from erosion, as weathering occurs without any significant movement of the rock or mineral in question. Erosion, on the other hand, involves movement of the rock by flowing media such as water or wind.    Weathering is an important process in the rock cycle as it breaks down larger rocks and minerals into soil, and also provides for the sediments that will eventually become sedimentary rocks under the right conditions. In this Earthcache, we will be looking at one particular type of rock weathering, known as chemical weathering.  Chemical Weathering  Chemical weathering occurs when the mineral and compounds in the rock react with substances from the surrounding environment to form new minerals. In most cases of chemical weathering, the minerals in the rock will either dissolve or react with rain water (which is slightly acidic due to dissolution of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere). When rocks undergo chemical weathering, their chemical composition will change significantly, with the particular elements being enriched in the rock in the process, while other elements will be significantly reduced.  The chief processes in chemical weathering are dissolution, where particular compounds will dissolve in water and be carried away, and hydrolysis, where these compounds react with the rain water instead. There are other processes such as carbonation, where the compounds in the rock react with carbonic acid, an acid which is a result of rain water reacting with carbon dioxide in the air. The reactions that take place will form new compounds (and in turn, creating a chemical composition change in the rock) which will alter the chemical composition of the rock. These new compounds form what is known as the secondary minerals of the rock.  Naturally, in a rock, the compounds which tend to react and\/or dissolve in water will be weathered first, as they tend to be washed away by rain water. The compounds which will be left behind in the rock are the compounds which are less reactive. This process will lead to a further alteration of the chemical composition of the rock, and with it, a significant change in the physical properties of the rock (as different compounds will exhibit different physical properties). Some of these compounds may be more brittle than the original rock, weakening it in the process, while others, may actually strengthen the rock.  Now that the basics of chemical weathering have been covered, let us look at the predominant form of chemical weathering that occurs in tropical weather conditions.  Tropical Weathering  The tropical climate is marked by alternate periods of heavy rainfall and dry spells which causes rocks to weather in a very particular manner. This process, known as laterisation, takes on the name of the soil it will produce, that is, laterite. We will now look into the process of laterisation proper.    Fig.1: Cross section of soil showing where laterite forms in soil   Laterisation    Laterite is a broad term used to describe the product of intensive chemical weathering under hot and humid tropical conditions. Laterite are formed from a variety of rocks (which span all three families of rocks; igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic), and these rocks are known as the parent rock. Over time, the parent rock, which is exposed to the harsh tropical climate, will begin to undergo intense and prolong weathering caused by the alternate heat and rainfall which will begin to alter and remove certain minerals from the rock, while leaving others behind. This process, where certain minerals are removed through rainwater seeping through the rock is known as leaching.  Potassium, calcium and sodium minerals: The first minerals that will begin to react with the acidic rainwater are the minerals containing sodium, potassium and calcium, which react fairly easily with water and acids. During the rainy season, the reaction intensifies due to the large volume of water seeping through the rock. In the dry season, the water within the rock will begin to move to the surface of the rock and evaporate, leaving the easily soluble sodium, potassium and calcium salts behind, which will be quickly washed away during the next rainy season.  Silicon: The next minerals to react are the silicon-based minerals. These compounds are usually quite stable and do not dissolve in water, but the reaction of the sodium, potassium and calcium minerals can significantly alter the pH of the water in the rock due to the bases that these minerals can form. These will begin to convert the normally stable silicon dioxide (SiO2) to silicate compounds (SiO44-), which are susceptible to hydrolysis by rainwater, and, eventually, wash away, causing a depletion of the silicon minerals, like quartz. This process is, however, is slow, and hence, plenty of quartz will tend to remain in the original rock.  What\u2019s left: After the minerals that are more reactive elements have been weathered, the rock is left with a high proportion of insoluble minerals. Minerals like bauxite (aluminium ore), hematite (iron ore) and nickel, zirconium, tin and titanium ores become dominant within the rock, changing its physical properties. The richness of particular elements in the original rock will determine which of the above minerals (and therefore, physical properties) will dominate the remaining rock. One of the tasks of this Earthcache is concerned with this aspect of the rock.         About Laterite  Laterite derives its name from the word later meaning \"brick\" as it was first described by geologists in South Asia, where the stone is used in the construction of buildings and temples. Despite its humble appearance, laterite stones have a dual quality that makes its extremely attractive to masons. It is easy to cut and shape when first removed from the ground, but becomes stronger when exposed to sunlight and air. (does this remind you of something?). A great testament to this remarkable property of laterite is the fact that many of the temples of the Angkorian civilisation were built almost primarily out of laterite. The great Angkor Wat itself has a foundation of laterite, but tiled with sandstone, as it is easier to carve intricate reliefs on sandstone.  Laterite soil is also rich in particular minerals, and indeed, it is the soil which yields most of the Earth's iron, nickel and aluminium ore. It also provides the topsoil for most of the Earth's rainforest, and the preferred soil of many commercial tropical crops, such as rubber and oil palm.  Tasks for this Earthcache  At the published coordinates, you will see several instances of laterite rocks on the side of the path. Inspect the rocks to answer the following questions:  What is the dominant colour of the laterite rocks? The colour should be familiar, one commonly associated with metal objects. Why is it of this colour and what can be said about the composition of the parent rock? Are the rocks smooth or porous (full of holes)? What are the range of sizes of the holes in the rock if any? Based on the information provided above, suggest a reason for this  Please message or email me the answers to the above tasks, and you may log immediately after that. I will be in touch of there are any issues with the answers, Have fun Earthcaching!","hint":"","total_found":"58","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":4630295,"code":"GC5E709","name":"Poirot meets his Waterloo (WIG)","geocacheType":1858,"containerType":2,"difficulty":2.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":27,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.2975,"longitude":103.85065,"ownerId":"PR6064Y","ownerName":"ZacharyKZH","placedDate":"2014-10-04","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-07","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC5E709","description":"Wherigo caches are interactive GPS-device based games which can be quite a lot of fun if you willing to learn the ropes. This type of cache has been noticably absent in Singapore in the past couple of years, so I've decided to try my hand at it. As long as you have a GPS-enabled device, like a smartphone (Apple and Android), a few models of Garmin GPSr or Pocket PC, you will be able to run the catridge. The following is a step-by-step guide on what to do:  If you have an Apple device, such as an iPad or an iPhone, you can download this free Wherigo app. Android phone users will have to download this (also) free app, called Whereyougo, for their devices. Garmin GPSr should already have the application pre-installed Ensure that the Location Services in your device is enabled. This can usually be found in the \"Settings > Privacy > Location Services\" for Apple devices. Be sure to set it to \"On\".  Once the application has been installed, be sure to give it authorisation to log onto your Geocaching Account. This is found somewhere in the app (under \"Search\" for Wherigo and \"Settings > Global\" in Whereyougo) Download the game catridge from the Wherigo website. It's all completely free, too. You can download it directly into your device, or through an external computer and transfer it later. Once the catridge is downloaded into your device, just pick \"Run with Wherigo\/Whereyougo\" if prompted, and the catridge name should appear in the application immediately. If the download is successful, you should see this: Tap the catridge name, and a brief description of the catridge will appear, as such: Tap \"Play\" and this screen should appear, with Locations (1) [The Singapore Art Museum]. If there is no number beside the \"Locations\", you need to reinstall the catridge. Tap \"Locations\", and you will receive the starting coordinates. Once you get there, the game will begin! Exciting, isn't it? I won't spoil what happens next.    Just a couple of other IMPORTANT technical notes before you start on this adventure:  The events (which include dialogues and puzzles) for each location will appear in your device about 50 metres away from the actual coordinates. Once these appear, the game assumes you have reached the target area and you will no longer see the coordinates for the WP. Therefore, if you need to know EXACTLY where to go or want to narrow the search area, YOU MUST take down the coordinates when you see the \"Welcome to...\" screen, which will look like the screen in Step 8. You can input the coordinates as next stage in the Geocaching App if you still need to navigate to the spot. Or, if you like an extra challenge, then just go ahead. You will have a larger search area to solve the puzzles. There are hints in the text, so don't skip them thinking they are irrelevant. Unfortunately, you will not be able to go back and read the text again... so, pay attention to the details, or the puzzles will be harder than they should be. You will NOT need to enter the premises of any of the buildings in the game (though in one case, you'll need some pretty sharp eyes). All the clues can be found from the street.  Have fun trying out this WIG, and do keep an open mind and be patient. The software is not perfect and this is my first time trying out a WIG, and there will always be a kink or two to iron out. I have both an Apple and Android device, so I can help out if you have issues there, but unfortunately I am clueless on how it works on the Garmin GPSr. In any case, let me know if you run into any trouble at any stage, but keep in mind the notes and warnings stated above.

Do read the description to learn more about pandemics in Singapore and hopefully solve the puzzle.  Most of us in Singapore will surely remember the viral outbreaks in the twenty-first century, 2003 SARS epidemic or the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and of course the current COVID-19 outbreak. But lets dive back into history and learn a little about those that were forgotten in time such as 1918\u20139, Spanish Flu; 1957\u20138, Asian Flu; and 1968, Hong Kong Flu, which Singapore was not spared from, being already a global trading city in the 20th century. The 1918 Pandemic in Singapore The 1918 Straits Settlements Annual Report described an influenza epidemic in June and July that was relatively mild, with a high illness rate but a low mortality rate, that peaked during the week ending July 6. The excess mortality rate for Singapore during the pandemic years of 1918\u201320 to be one point seven-five percent. The excess mortality rate for Singapore during the 1918 pandemic years was higher than rates for most industrialized countries such as the United States and those for western Europe, but lower than rates for African and Asian countries such Kenya, South Africa, India, and the Philippines. The 1957 Pandemic in Singapore The media declared the 1957 pandemic as the \u201cworst ever in colony [Singapore] history\u201d. The outbreak was first recognized at the end of April and early May and was purported to have spread through Hong Kong from its origins in northern Asia.47.6% of the patients who came to government and city council clinics were treated for influenzaBy May the fifth, the outbreak had become an epidemic, reaching its peak in mid-May and tapering off by the end of the month. The government focused on public health measures, including closure of schools for almost 2 weeks because of illness and absenteeism. The 1968 Pandemic in Singapore The 1968 pandemic was the mildest of the three pandemics.The virus was believed to have spread from a major outbreak in Hong Kong. Attendance at outpatient dispensaries increased over a 2-week period, and at the peak daily attendance increased by 65%. The 1968 epidemic caused substantial illness and absenteeism from work. However, because of the relatively mild and short epidemic, no substantial measures were adopted. COVID-19 updates China has finally decided to scrap its zero-COVID policy and scrap quarantine measures for overseas arrivals starting Jan 8. However, this move has led to other nations being worried. First to make a move was India, re-imposing the need to have negative COVID test for 5 countries (China,Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand). Our neighbours across the causway also had some contingency plans in mind. Travellers from China will only be screened for fever, Malaysia\u2019s health minister said, but waste water from their inbound flights will be tested as it can indicate Covid positivity earlier than nasal or throat swabs.   As of 29 November 2021, the total number of individuals who have completed their full regimen\/ received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines is ninety-six percent of the eligible population.Over the past day, 1,399 cases were discharged, of whom 276 are seniors aged 60 years and above. 1,239 new cases of COVID-19 infection were detected, with 1,193 in the community, 24 in the migrant worker dormitories and 22 imported cases.

Today is DongZhi\r (a.k.a Tang Chek in local Hokkien) On this day the Chinese people eat\r tangyuan (rice dumplings),\r a kind of stuffed small sweet ball of glutinous rice flour cooked\r in a sweet soup or savoury\r broth.\r Tangyuan can be used as\r offerings to ancestors or gifts for friends and\r relatives. The Chinese word tang (meaning \u201csoup\u201d)\r sounds like tuan, which means\r reunion, while yuan means round, also\r means perfect and happy. The entire phrase tangyuan therefore symbolizes \"tuanyuan\" (family\r reunion), and eating it at Dongzhi\r signifies family unity and prosperity. And for even better luck,\r some families prefer to have pink tangyuan mixed in with white\r ones. As pink and red are auspicious colours for the Chinese. Everyone must have his or her bowl of tangyuan before the day\r is over.   For the Tans, the day is even more special. For Mr.\r Tan\u2019s Chinese birthday also falls of DongZhi. So the family has a double celebration. When it is ready, the Tans settle at the table for\r their celebration.   \u201cYou know, Dad.

This cache is located on the other end of the Walk of the Five Kings from another cache, the Ruler of Singapura, which highlights some of Singapore's early history as recounted by the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals).  To find this cache, make your way to Badang Terrace, a spot that was likely the location of a stone-lifting competition between the Strong Man of Singapore, named Badang, and the champion of the King of Kalinga. As the story goes, the King of the Kingdom of Kalinga in modern day India wanted to challenge the tiny Kingdom of Singapura to a duel to basically show who's the boss. So, the King of Kalinga sent 7 ships filled with treasures, along with their strongest man to challenge the King of Singapura, Sri Rama Wira Kerma.  Sri Rama Wira Kerma sent for Badang, who had, in the past, performed some amazing favours for the King, including climbing a tree to get a fruit, during which he fell off the branch, and split a rock in two with his head, and single-handedly launching the Royal Barge into the sea. The two man duelled, initially in a wrestling match which was inconclusive. Thus, the final challenge was devised, where both men would lift a rock and toss it as far as they could. The Champion from Kalinga could barely lift the boulder, but Badang proved to be truly worthy, and flung the rock all the way to the mouth of the Singapore River.    Now, it's easy to dismiss this whole tale as myth, (especially Badang's origin story, where he swallowed some evil spirit's puke to gain his strength, eww...), but in the 19th century, the British found a stone with carved words that no one could decipher at the exact location described in the story. Unfortunately, in true British fashion, the Municipal Engineer found the stone to be a bit of a nuisance to development work and decided to blow the legendary stone up. After the initial outrage and shock at the lost of such an important artifact of early Sigapore history, some museum curators were quick to retrieve some of the largest pieces of the stone. One of the fragments, now known as the Singapore Stone, is a National Treasure held in the collections of the National Museum of Singapore, which you can visit on the other side of the Hill after finding this cache. On the Terrace today, you can get a view of the Singapore River valley, and see how far Badang had to throw that rock. There is also a information board with the story of Badang and a small replica of the Singapore Stone you can look at (and maybe even try to lift). The cache itself is in hidden plain sight on the Terrace, so be discreet! Enjoy this lovely spot in the city and the hunt for the cache!

When playing an Adventure Lab Cache, you will get ONE Cache Find for each of the location when you ge the correct answer! So, if you complete this Adventure you will receive five Lab Cache finds, and of course, once you sign the log for this bonus cache you will have a Mystery find as well! About Coleman's Chronicles Welcome to Singapore's first Adventure Lab Cache! In this Adventure, we will take a journey back to the founding of modern Singapore and walk in the footsteps of one George Drumgoole Coleman, an important but overlooked figure in the founding of this city. Coleman was a prolific and prominent architect in Singapore's early years and as Singapore's first municipal architect, he had a hand in designing many of Singapore's earliest buildings, many of them now gazetted as National Monuments. He also played a part of in the implementation of Raffles' Town Plan, and the contributed to the alignment of many of the main roads in Civic District. We will follow George Coleman's story in Singapore, beginning with his first construction commission from Sir Stamford Raffles in 1822 to his eventual passing in 1844. There are 5 locations to be found, each representing a key event in Coleman's career in Singapore. The walk, including the bonus cache, is a one- to two-hour walking loop around the Civic District. There will be some mild hill climbing up Fort Canning Hill involved on proper park trails, but nothing too strenous. All answers to the question can be found on site, so no Googling involved. However, you will need mobile data coverage for the app to work.  Finally, a big thank you to all the intrepid testers: colincorgi, riskysurv, TheMTheory, kwek_ke and swirlywirly for taking some time off your weekend to play-test this cache!  The Bonus Cache To find the bonus cache, you will need 5 clues from each of the 5 locations you visited for the Adventure Lab cache. The method of deriving the final coordinates is as follows: STEP 1: Calculate the value of (A + B + C + D + E) \/ 100. You should get a number in the form of XX.X where the three digits sum to 19.  STEP 2:  To get the minutes for the northings, subtract 40.115 from XX.X found in Step 1. To get the minutes for the eastings, subtract 6.831 from XX.X found in Step 1.    STEP 3: Check your answer in the Checker below, and make the short walk to the final. You should find yourself in a lovely little themed garden. Use the hint provided if you are stuck.

As long as you have a GPS-enabled device, like a smartphone (Apple and Android), a few models of Garmin GPSr or Pocket PC, you will be able to run the catridge. The following is a step-by-step guide on what to do:  If you have an Apple device, such as an iPad or an iPhone, you can download this free Wherigo app. Android phone users will have to download this (also) free app, called Whereyougo, for their devices. Garmin GPSr should already have the application pre-installed Ensure that the Location Services in your device is enabled. This can usually be found in the \"Settings > Privacy > Location Services\" for Apple devices. Be sure to set it to \"On\".  Once the application has been installed, be sure to give it authorisation to log onto your Geocaching Account. This is found somewhere in the app (under \"Search\" for Wherigo and \"Settings > Global\" in Whereyougo) Download the game catridge from the Wherigo website. It's all completely free, too. You can download it directly into your device, or through an external computer and transfer it later. Once the cartidge is downloaded into your device, just pick \"Run with Wherigo\/Whereyougo\" if prompted, and the cartidge name should appear in the application immediately.  I don't want to spoil the details of quest you will be undertaking, so I can't say very much other than the fact that you ought to turn up at the published coordinates. Once you reach the coords, the WIG should activate and provide you your tasks. Be mindful of the muggles around you, of course, but you should be able to blend it quite naturally. After all, the National Library area is a much visited place by those who seek the treasures of knowledge and you won't be doing anything that looks out of place.  Have fun exploring the areas in and around the wonderful National Library building. If you have any issues, you may read the notes in my other WIG: Poirot meets his Waterloo. If there are any issues with the cartridge, please contact me via the geocaching website, and I will be more than happy to help!   A couple more technical notes related to the WIG: On the Wherigo download page, you will see an \"Unlock\" button. The \"unlocking\" is just the WIG term for completing the cartridge. At the end of the game, you will receive a password from the cartridge and when you input that in the \"Unlock\" option, you will be able to mark the cartridge as \"Completed\"on the WIG site. The game will end (and provide you with the unlock code) once you reach the GZ, at which point you are allowed to log it as found on the WIG site. However, you need to find the physical cache to log it here on the Geocaching site. You need not have to log the cache on both sites, especially if you forgot to take down the unlock code. The answers to the puzzles are not case-sensitive, and you have unlimited attempts at the answers, but as I have pointed out, you will not be able to see all the text that has appeared before the puzzle. You can leave the game and close the app at any time, and your progress will be saved. So, if you need to come back another day, you can without having to start the WIG all over at the start. However, I have found that the WIG occasionally crashes on my iPad due to insufficient memory, so if that happens, I advise shutting down any other apps you have running at that time.","hint":"if the white object is still missing, complete this phrase: \"boom or ....\"","total_found":"109","total_did_not_find":"7"},{"id":7842683,"code":"GC8Y1QP","name":"Can You Read My Mind?","geocacheType":8,"containerType":2,"difficulty":3.0,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":2,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.2892,"longitude":103.8451,"ownerId":"PR6064Y","ownerName":"ZacharyKZH","placedDate":"2020-08-08","lastFoundDate":"2023-04-20","lastFoundTime":"08:41:53","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC8Y1QP","description":"The published coordinates are not the location of the cache, though it does serve as the setting for this puzzle. To get the exact coordinates of the cache, you\u2019ll need to be able to \u201cRead\u201d my mind. Some Historical Context One of the historic bridges across the Singapore River is Read Bridge, named after William H. M. Read, a prominent merchant and magistrate in the late 19th century Singapore. The bridge was constructed in 1887, replacing an older bridge at same location. The bridge, being in the heart of Singapore\u2019s mercantile district, was the focal point of social and recreational activities in the Clarke Quay area. Teochew coolies, merchants and boatmen would often congregate on the bridge after their long day of work to unwind by listening to traditional storytellers or watching performances such as street operas. And, with that historical context set out, let\u2019s move on to the puzzle: The Mind-Reader   A crowd had gathered around a small table by the edge of Read Bridge, with men jostling with each other to take a look at some spectacle. Curious, I pushed my way through to try to see what was going on. There were two men performing some sort of card trick, in exchange for a small wager - something that the audience happily obliged for the sake of figuring out the mechanism of what appeared to be an impossible trick. The trick starts, as most of these do, with a member of the audience drawing five cards at random from a standard deck of 52 cards. The audience reveals the cards to one of the two men, but not the other, (let\u2019s call them X and Y, respectively). In other words, X knows what the 5 cards are, but Y doesn\u2019t. X then places 4 out of the 5 cards face up on the table, for example:  and the fifth card is handed back to the audience member. The second man, Y, stared intently at the cards on the table, muttered a few magic incantations and announced that he know the identity of the missing card. He confidently proclaims, \u201cMy good sir, I believe the card in your hand is the 9 of Hearts!\u201d They repeat the trick a second time, just to convince the audience that it was not just a lucky guess. Another audience member drew five cards, rather cheekily I must add, by merely picking 5 consecutive cards from the middle of the deck. X chuckled at his attempt to foil them, and placed the 4 cards on the table:  After returning the fifth card, Y circled the table, looking intently at the cards from different angles. After 3 circuits, Y announced \u201cI would like to go out on a limb here and claim that you have the 10 of Diamonds in your hand.\u201d The audience member placed his card back on the table, and indeed it was as suggested. At this point, a sceptic in audience tried to dismiss this as a lucky fluke, and challenges the performing duo to repeat the trick for a wager of a dollar. The sceptic drew five cards from the deck, cautiously trying to pick out cards from different parts of the deck, and handed them over to X. X placed four cards on the table, and returns the fifth card to the sceptic:  Y did his \u201cmagical\u201d hand motions and muttered a few more words, before announcing that the missing card was the Queen of Clubs. The sceptic couldn\u2019t believe his ears and surrendered a coin to the pair. Another person in the crowd suggested that the deck of cards must have had been marked in some way... to some murmurs from the other that this was such an obvious trick. He produces his own slightly tattered deck of cards, and challenged the duo to another round. He skilfully shuffled his deck a few times, and draws out 5 cards. X received the cards, inspected them for a few seconds and places 4 cards down on the table:  The remaining card was passed back to the audience member, and Y did his usual tricks and correctly announced that he was sure the last card was the 3 of Diamonds, much to the dismay of the man who would soon lose his dollar. Now, speculation was rife among those present about how the predictions were so accurate. A lady insisted that there must be some sort of visual clue from X\u2019s body language that would enable Y to figure out the missing card. Upon hearing that, Y offered to have himself blindfolded throughout the duration of the trick. Y tied a handkerchief over his eyes, and 5 more cards were picked. X read out loud 4 of the cards in his hand, which were as follows:  and returned the fifth card to the lady. Y remained calm, said a few \u201cmagic words\u201d, and, with just a slight quiver in his voice, claimed that the fair lady must be holding on the 9 of Hearts. He was proven correct once again!         The crowd, now positively baffled by the trick, tried a last ditch effort to foil the efforts of the duo. Believing that there must be some sort of signal one man must be sending to the other, a group of teenagers proposed physically separating X and Y. Y would be sent to the other end of the bridge, and a neutral person would convey the message from X and prediction from Y. A large wager was set, and the duo agreed to the terms. Y was sent off, blindfolded, to the other end of Read Bridge. Once he was there, 5 cards were drawn by an audience member and X chose the 4 cards that were to be revealed, and a messenger was sent to convey the verbal information to Y which were as follows:   After some deliberation, Y made a prediction, and sent the messenger back with the response: \u201cThe 2 of Clubs!\u201d he announced, and the crowd gasped. Yet again, the prediction was correct!    Everyone was at a loss at how the feat was accomplished. The chattering and whispering continued for a good few minutes, before a smartly dressed gentlemen cleared his throat loudly. The crowd turned to look for the interlocutor, and once he commanded their attention, the man said, \u201cI believe I know how the trick is accomplished. And to prove it, I am willing to wager all of my money.\u201d A stunned silence ensued. He continued, \u201cTo prove my point, I will make not one, but three predictions for three different sets of cards as drawn by anyone here. If I can get any one of the cards wrong, I am willing to part with all of my money. But, you must agree that you repeat the trick exactly as you would have done previously.\u201d All eyes turned to the duo, who were as flabbergasted as the audience by the offer. A few tense moments later, X stepped forward, and accepted the deal. They shook hands, and the stranger agreed to step back from the table as the cards were drawn. Gingerly, X laid the three sets of cards on the table, each with one card removed. They were as follows:  The man was invited back to the table to inspect the cards laid out. He stroked his chin, looking carefully at the position of each card. Finally satisfied, he produced a piece of paper and a pencil, wrote down what seemed like calculations, and folded the paper. He passed the paper to Y and said, \u201cThese are my predictions. You have a choice now: if you choose to read my predictions, the earlier terms of the wager still hold. Or, you can choose to walk away\u2026 and the bet is off\u201d.         The Puzzle To obtain the final coordinates for this cache, you must figure out how to \u201cRead\u201d the mind of the magicians and figure out how the predictions were made based on the 6 rounds that were played in the story. Apply your hypotheses to the final three sets of cards, and make your predictions! If your predictions are correct, you get the prize of the final cache. To enter your predictions into Certitude, use the following key:  Enter the three cards separated by a comma (,). Each card will be entered as a pair of characters, the first being the card value, followed by the card suit. The card value will range from A (Ace), 2 \u2013 10 (Number Cards), and finally J, Q, K (Jack, Queen, King) The card suit will be C, D, H and S for clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades, respectively. For example, AD is the Ace of Diamonds, 5H is the 5 of Hearts and KC is the King of Clubs.  So, a possible entry to Certitude could be 5H,AD,KC (no spaces). Remember to input your answer in the correct order of the final 3 sets played in the story.  Good luck with the puzzle and enjoy the final location! Note: The Contract Bridge conventions for the relative card and suit values are used for this puzzle.

So many, that it might feel a bit overwhelming. Where to start? How to make time for puzzle solving? What do I do when I get stuck? This event is (part of) the answer! Let's just get together and solve puzzles for a couple of hours. Maybe we can even find and log one or two of them together after the event?  \u2014 Puzzle Caches?: the most common type of Mystery cache, represented by the blue ? icon on the map. They are not located at the published coordinates, and require a puzzle to be solved before the true coordinates are obtained. The physical cache can be found and logged thereafter, just like any normal cache. What's This Event About?: a gentle introduction to fundamental techniques of puzzle solving (in the Geocaching context), and a little bit of hands-on fun. The key is practice, after all. Oh, also brunch, and a little catch-up, as all events are. Ok, I'm in!: log a simple 'Will Attend'. If you like, you can add the GC code(s) of (a) puzzle(s) that you'd like ot make progress on.  We'll see you at what was once upon a time SGSH III HQ\u2060\u2014Hanis Cafe & Bakery at the National Library building, Saturday 20 May, 10:30am. Or come and go anytime you please. You sign the logbook, you get to log your attendance. Even if you're not really into puzzles, we'll still trade TBs and stories :) What do I bring?: something to write with, and something to write on, would be great. Now, a lot of puzzles are much easier to solve, or even only solveable, using a computer. A tablet or laptop will make puzzling way easier, as you might discover during the lesson. You could bring yours, or you could just watch or share with someone, it's up to you. See below note on Wi-Fi. What else do I prepare?: nothing much, just come bright and awake :). If you'd like some headstart though, you could consider some optional, recommended reading:  How Do I Solve These #@&%$ Puzzle Caches?!! (BM2M1EV) Pesky Coordinate Conversions (GC9HGR5)  It may also be interesting to scroll through the Geocaching Toolbox website for inspiration. See you there! :) \u2014 Note on Wi-Fi: if you're going to need Wi-Fi access at the NLB building, you'll need to pre-install the Wireless@SGx app onto your device and set up the wireless profile on your device before coming, while you have internet access elsewhere. Yeah, I know..   Credits: Many thanks to calikura for kicking my behind encouraging me to get this event submitted, and for letting me copy most of his text from the previous puzzle-solving event.

It is said to be over a century old, although the exact circumstances surrounding its original construction are unclear, besides that it was likely used for freshwater provision (like the other reservoirs dotting our island), before being repurposed for swimming and leisure.

This Adventure will take you to 5 locations - each location will require a question to be answered before you can move to the next location. When playing an Adventure Lab Cache, you will get ONE Cache Find for each of the location when you get the correct answer! So, if you complete this Adventure you will receive five Lab Cache finds, and of course, once you sign the log for this bonus cache you will have a Mystery find as well! About This Adventure Lab Cache Welcome to an Adventure Lab that will bring you on a short stroll through Kampong Glam to introduce some of lesser-known sights in this historic quarter of the city. The distance you will need to walk for this entire Adventure (including the bonus) is just under a kilometre and should take about 30 minutes, at a leisurely pace. The entire route, including the tasks, are kid- and disabled-friendly and available at all hours of the day. The Kampong Glam district, which traces its name to the Gelam tree, is one of Singapore\u2019s historical ethnic enclaves. It was home to a diversity of people from across the Muslim world, developing around the Sultan Mosque as its focal point. From the Arab merchants of the Middle East to the Bugis people of the Indonesian archipelago, the area has always been a hub of Malay and Muslim culture in the city, and many buildings here today celebrate this diversity and history.  The Final Cache To get the coordinates for this cache, check the journal entry for the last waypoint of the Adventure Lab. You will also get a hint for the cache's hiding spot there.  If you are finding this cache as part of the Singapore Geocaching Scavenger Hunt - take note of the following:  If you are the First To Find, log your find in the logbook and retrieve the item in the cache container and bring it back to the Cache Owner for verification, and some bonus points.

The Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park is a Singaporean adaptation of a public speaking area of the same name, located at Hyde Park in London: the first and perhaps the most widely known around the world. Speakers' Corners have also been established in large cities in a number of other countries to serve a similar purpose.  Speakers' Corner, Hyde Park, London, UK In the 90s and before, the Singapore government was apprehensive about shifting their stance on public speech, assembly and demonstration, as they were concerned about the risk of public disorder that the country was no stranger to in her formative years. In those days, if one intended to give a public speech, permission in the form of a Public Entertainment Licence was necessary. It was only after suggestions by an esteemed political scientist, a rather prominent opposition politician, and reminders of each Singaporean's constitutional rights to free speech and assembly, that Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park was finally established in September 2000. Hong Lim Park was a natural choice not only for its central location, but also its roots as a popular venue for political rallies in the preceding decades. The newly-established Speakers' Corner was a far cry from what it is today. In its first few years, it was open only from 7am to 7pm, and one had to obtain a permit from the nearby Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post in order to give public speeches. Restrictions were gradually relaxed to allow exhibitions and performances (2004), and later, demonstrations (2008). You could also begin registering online your intended use of the space. Since then, a number of notable outdoor rallies, demonstrations and events have been held at Speakers' Corner, from one-off protests against dolphin captivity, capital punishment and Lehman Brothers, to the annual Pink Dot SG. Notably, topics related to race and religion remain forbidden.  The Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post - then (left) and now (right) Speak Now... As for the cache title, well, the history is a lot more straightforward here. The phrase has its roots in European and Christian wedding ceremony custom. It was customarily said to the audience by the officiant of the ceremony, prior to asking the bride and groom their consent to the marriage.  The long form of the phrase is of course: \"Should anyone present know of any reason that this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.\"; presumably that if any of the witnesses present that day were privy to any imminently adulterous affairs or the like they would spill the beans then, or never. Anyway, moving along\u2014 The Geocache You are looking for a grey semi-camouflaged micro (or nano, depending on how you see it) placed just a stone's throw from Hong Lim Park and one of the entrances to Clarke Quay MRT station. It is hidden at a quiet corner away from the prying eyes of CCTV surveillance all around the park and the station (but not from regular muggle foot traffic, unfortunately!). While you aren't going to be seen as a security threat searching for a cache at the posted coordinates, you'll need to exercise some stealth in order to protect the hide from compromise. The cache is in a public area and accessible 24\/7, although you will find foot traffic substantially lower at night, and on weekends. BYOP and please replace the cache exactly as found.

The cache is not at the published coordinates. You will need to complete the Adventure Lab cache titled Cryptography 101 to get the final coordinates. This listing is for the physical bonus cache for the Geocaching Adventure Lab cache. To learn more about how Adventure Lab caches work and how to find this new type of cache, you can read about it here.   How to Find This Adventure Lab Cache To play any Adventure Lab Cache, download the Official Adventure Lab app from your App store (either Apple App Store or Google Play). Once installed on your phone, you can search for the Adventure Lab to begin.  Once you are close to the starting location (the published coordinates of this cache), you will be given the first question to answer, and getting each correct answer will unlock the next location. This Adventure will take you to 5 locations - each location will require a question to be answered before you can move to the next location. When playing an Adventure Lab Cache, you will get ONE Cache Find for each of the location when you get the correct answer! So, if you complete this Adventure you will receive five Lab Cache finds, and of course, once you sign the log for this bonus cache you will have a Mystery find as well! About This Adventure Lab Cache Welcome to an Adventure Lab which will bring you on a short tour of a revitalised heritage district while teaching you a thing or two about Cryptography. This AL is centred around the South Beach Precinct which was once the Headquarters of the Straits Settlement Volunteer Force. These colonial buildings remain, and they will be the subjects of our tour. However, there\u2019s more! This is also an AL about cryptography: the science of concealing messages. Many puzzle caches employ such techniques to add a layer of complexity to their solutions. Hence, if you are new to puzzle-solving, you may want an intro to the types of ciphers that exist. Each waypoint introduces you to a category of ciphers. While most of the ciphers can be solved using online tools, if you like a challenge, you can still do them by pen and paper. You will need to read the descriptions to find the keywords on site and decode the cipher. Once you solve all 5 ciphers, you will have all you need to find the bonus cache.  The Final Cache The coordinates for this AL Bonus cache, along with other relevant information to retrieve the cache can be found in the 5 Journal Entries you will gain when you visit and solve all 5 puzzles in the Adventure Lab. Please be gentle with the final cache, and be careful when retrieving and replacing the container. Do be stealthy as there may be muggles watching you from afar, and make sure the cache is secure in its hide before leaving the GZ.

Primarily a gin-based cocktail, the Singapore Sling also contains pineapple juice, lime juice, cura\u00e7ao and B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine. Giving it the pretty pink hues are grenadine and cherry liqueur. Bartender Ngiam deliberately chose to give the cocktail this rosy colour.. \r Following the turn of the century in colonial Singapore, Raffles was the gathering place for the community \u2013 and Long Bar was the watering hole. It was common to see gentlemen nursing glasses of gin or whisky. Unfortunately for the ladies, etiquette dictated that they could not consume alcohol in public. So, for the sake of modesty, teas and fruit juices were their beverages of choice. \r Ever insightful, Ngiam thus saw a niche in the market and decided to create a cocktail that looks like plain fruit juice but is actually infused with gin and liqueurs. The clever bartender made the beverage pink to give it a feminine flair which, together with the use of clear alcohol, led people to think it was a socially acceptable drink for women. With that, the Singapore Sling was born. Needless to say, it became an instant hit.   HOW TO GET THERE: \r * The Raffles Hotel is just next to City Hall MRT Station.   REQUIREMENTS: \r The posted coordinates will bring you to the main entrance of The Raffles Hotel. Walk along Bras Basah Road to the side of the hotel and you will come to a flight of stairs to the Long Bar. (See spoiler picture). \r 1. Along the stairs, there is a mural titled 2015. How many people are featured in this picture? Let this be A. 2. Send an email to gcraffles8A@gmail.com and replace A with the number derived from the above question.

It is next to Exit 4 at the Outram Park MRT station; the exit you\u2019d use going to or from Chinatown. At Outram Park ascend the Exit 4 stairs and leave the MRT. Immediately on the right, examine the natural collage of metamorphic minerals making up the stone cladding around the entrance to the Dorsett Hotel in the corner of the precinct, next to the station. This can be viewed from the pedestrian precinct. The Geological Background The rock itself is a garnet-staurolite schist which has been sourced from the Chapada Diamantina region of Bahia state, in the Northeast of Brazil. It is a regionally metamorphosed rock which probably started life as a fine-grained mud on the bottom of the sea-floor. This was compacted by further sediment deposited on top to form a sedimentary rock called shale. The ocean floor was later compressed by tectonic forces and the shale subjected to high temperatures and pressures as it was squeezed between two converging lithospheric (tectonic) plates. The temperatures and pressures generated were sufficient to allow the original clay minerals in the shale to recrystalise (but not melt) to form minerals such as mica (both muscovite and biotite), garnet and staurolite. Figure 1 shows the range of minerals you might expect to see in a rock of this type.  Figure 1 This mineral composition is typical of a group of metamorphic rocks (a metamorphic facies) called the amphibolite facies that forms under medium pressure and average to high temperature. Both garnet and staurolite are index minerals; the presence of which gives an estimate of the temperatures and pressures of metamorphism at the time of their formation. (Figure 2).  Figure 2 Whilst the minerals that make up the finely-crystalline groundmass of the rock and are difficult to see without a hand lens, the ruby coloured garnets and darker, blade-like staurolite form large, well-shaped (euhedral) crystals called porphyroblasts, which gives the schist a porphyroblastic texture. (Figure 3). A porphyroblastic texture is one in which larger minerals are set in a finer crystalline groundmass. This may show a 'preferred mineral orientation' in which minerals are aligned\/orientated as a result of pressure from one direction as they grew.   Figure 3 To log this EarthCache please send the answers to the questions below through the Message Centre.  But more importantly just take a few moments to stand back and admire Nature\u2019s Artwork. Logging details The co-ordinates will take you to view the facing stone from the pedestrian precinct next to Exit 4 of the Outram Park MRT station. Here you will find the answers to the following questions.  What other minerals (in addition to micas, garnet and staurolite) does Figure 1 indicate you would expect to find in the groundmass of this garnet-staurolite schist ? Refer to Figure 2. State the highest temperature and highest pressure at which a rock of the Amphibolite facies is likely to have formed. Estimate the size of the largest garnet and the longest staurolite crystals you can see. Describe the orientation of the staurolite crystals and suggest if you think they show a 'preferred mineral orientation\" (i.e: a particular direction of growth of the crystals). Look closely at the garnets and staurolite crystals and try to work out which of the two might have formed first. Explain your reasoning (See hint if you need help) Using a scale, take a photo of any part of the stone to show the beauty of Nature\u2019s Artwork. Use an appropriate object as the scale (this could be whatever is available \u2013 GPS unit, coin, pen, ticket, finger; use your imagination).

This Earthcache aims to unravel the mystery of the Dragon Tooth Gate in Labrador Park, and, perhaps, you\u2019ll also learn a thing or two about the rocks that define the region. Sailing into the Dragon\u2019s Mouth The defining landmarks of Keppel Harbour were a pair of large stone outcrops that guarded both sides of the entrance to Keppel Harbour. One of the rocks was located here at the headland of Tanjong Berlayar, and the other was at Tanjong Rimau on Sentosa Island. These rocks were known for a long time, almost as far back as the 14th century. One of the earliest records of settlements on the modern day island of Singapore, by a Chinese traveller and trader known as Wang Dayuan, recorded a place with the name \u201cLong Ya Men\u201d, which means Dragon Tooth Gate. Scholars believe that he was referring to these rocks, which were a prominent landmark for any traveller passing through the region.  Later maps by the Portuguese and the Dutch refer to the rocks variously as Lot\u2019s Wife or Batu Berlayar (from Malay, meaning Sailing Rock), a testament to their prominence on the coastline of Singapore Island. Many traders rounding the Malay Peninsular would use the rocks as a navigational landmark of the Western Entrance to Keppel Harbour, which was one of the many common routes taken. However, the presence of the rocks were forgotten by the 17th Century, when a more southern route was preferred. The rocks were \u201crediscovered\u201d in the 19th Century, when William Farquhar, then Resident of Singapore, found Keppel Harbour to the west of the Singapore River and suggested that a new harbour be built there. However, this renewed knowledge of the rocks would signal the death knell for them. As Keppel Harbour gained importance as Singapore\u2019s main port-of-call, replacing the already crowded Singapore River, traffic along the narrow entrance meant that it was more pragmatic to destroy them. So, in 1848, John Thomson, Singapore\u2019s chief surveyor had the rocks blown up to widen the harbour entrance and the harbour lost its faithful guardians.  In July 2005, a replica of the Dragon Tooth Gate was put up near the original spot of the Batu Berlayar. It was meant to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the expedition of the illustrious Admiral Zheng Ho, who embarked on a diplomatic mission across Southeast Asia and South Asia to spread the influence of the Chinese Ming Dynasty and the forge ties with the nations of the region. Today, the replica stands tall, reminded visitors of the grand landmark that once stood here, welcoming visitors to Singapore. What Made Up the Dragon Teeth? Some sources claim that the teeth were \u201ccraggy granite outcrops\u201d, but this is very unlikely, given the geology of the region. So, what could the Dragon\u2019s Tooth be made out of then? The south-western part of Singapore is made out of by various beds of sedimentary rocks known collectively as the Jurong Formation. The Jurong Formation extends from the Southern Islands and continues north-west towards the western end of Singapore Island. The terrain formed by this formation are a series of islands and low ridges and hills, which runs parallel to the Bukit Timah Fault. The sediments making up the rock are believed to be a combination of weathered material from Bukit Timah Granite and a mixture of river and marine sediments. The formation is made up of a number of different types of sedimentary rocks, which includes siltstones, mudstones, sandstones, shales, limestones and conglomerates. More information about how to identify these rocks can be found in an Earthcache on the other side of the harbour, on Sentosa Island. For today, however, we\u2019ll be focusing on the rocks that could have formed the Dragon\u2019s Tooth. To figure out this mystery, we turn to a prominent outcrop of rocks at the published coordinates. The rocks here are a good example of a sedimentary rock of the Rimau Facies, one of the components of the Jurong Formation.  Sedimentary rocks come in several forms. One of these is sandstone, which is composed primarily of sand-sized particles (0.0625-2mm) in size.  Conglomerates rocks are collections of coarse-rocks (>2 mm) of various types glued together by a \u201cmatrix\u201d, which acts like a form of natural concrete. They are made up of bits and pieces of other rocks (known as clasts) which are eroded from other sources and stuck together. Now, it\u2019s your turn to figure out what \u201crocks\u201d make up this larger rock. Earthcache tasks:  Inspect the rocks closely. Describe the composition of the rock -- is it homogeneous or made up of different components? If you can see components, what size are they?  Based on your observations and the description, what kind of rock do you think this is?  Compare the colour of the rocks here with the replica of the Dragon Tooth Gate nearby (N01\u00b0 15.775' E103\u00b0 48.325'). Are they similar? Based on your answer, what type of rock do you think made up the original Dragon Tooth Gate.  Take a picture of yourself or your GPS at the Dragon Tooth Gate and post it with your log.  You may log the Earthcache once you have sent the email with your answers. There is no need to wait for a reply. If the answers are inaccurate or if there are any issues with the log, we will let you know.

Designed based on the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, the foundation stone was laid on the 15th of November, 1920, by Sir Lawrence Nunns Guillemard, then Governor of the Straits Settlement. The monument was completed in 1922, and unveiled on the 31st of March that year by the then Prince of Wales (who was later crowned as King Edward VIII). In 1950, an additional inscription was added to the other side of the memorial to honour the soldiers who lost their lives during World War II and during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore.   \r The monument is built from granite and stands at a height of 20 metres. The WWI side of the memorial bears the inscription \u201cOur Glorious Dead\u201d along with the years 1914 \u2013 1918, both on the front and on the steps. The reverse side, facing the Esplanade bears the words \u201cThey Died so That We May Live\u201d, and the years 1939 \u2013 1945 on the front and on the steps.   \r The monument is now located in the historic Esplanade Park, which once boasted a sea view before the extensive land reclamation took place. Also in this park are the Tan Kim Seng Fountain, the Lim Bo Seng memorial and the Indian Army Monument site. Across the road from the Cenotaph are the Town Green (Padang) and the City Hall and Supreme Court buildings. \r Your task in this Earthcache is to examine the rocks that make up the Cenotaph closely and answer the questions at the end of this listing.  An Introduction to Granite \r Granite takes its name from the Latin granum, which means \u201cgrainy\u201d, referring to its distinctive large grainy texture, from which it derives its beauty from. Granite is widely used in tiling and flooring because of the wide variety of colours it occurs in, the ease of smoothening and polishing it without cracking, its strength and hardness and its ability of parts of it to shimmer and shine when light strikes on its surface. Granite has also been used as foundational building materials for millennia, taking as far back as some of the earliest civilisations. Entire Egyptian tombs and obelisks have been carved out of granite and their existence today testifies to the strength of granite. Granite continues to be used as prime building material in recent times, and the Cenotaph is an example of one such monument.   \r Geologically speaking, granite is described as an igneous rock, a rock that is formed from the cooling of magma or lava that originates from the Earth\u2019s mantle. Within the igneous rock family, it is considered to be a plutonic (or intrinsic), felsic, igneous rock. I have covered the basics of classifying igneous rocks in my other Earthcache in Singapore, Gombak Norite Formation (http:\/\/coord.info\/GC41060), and you may want to read the description on that page for a more in-depth explanation on these terms. In this page, I will quickly cover what plutonic and felsic means.  Plutonic (from the Latin Pluto, which refers to the mythical Underworld) are rocks that are formed by the cooling of magma deep in the Earth\u2019s crust. The slow cooling in the relatively high temperatures deep in the crust causes the minerals to form large crystals, like that which is observed in granite.  Felsic refers to the elemental composition of the rock. Felsic is formed from the words feldspar and silicon, meaning that the rock contains a large percentage of feldspar and silicon minerals.  Composition of Granite \r Being a felsic rock, it should be clear that the main components of granite are feldspar and quartz, both of which are silicon based minerals. Granite also contains smaller amounts of other minerals which are referred to as accessory minerals. We shall now consider these components in turn.  Quartz:  One of the two main components of granite is quartz, a crystallised form of silicon dioxide, SiO2, and one of two most abundant minerals in the Earth\u2019s crust. In granite, quartz will present itself as cloudy to translucent crystals nestled between the more opaque components of the rock, giving the rock part of its beautiful shine.  Feldspar: Feldspar (from German feld meaning \u201cfield\u201d and spar meaning \u201crock\u201d, referring to how easily this mineral is found) is the Earth\u2019s most common mineral, making up a full 60% of the Earth\u2019s crust. Chemically, feldspar is defined as a mineral formed when silicon and oxygen combines with the Group 1 \u2013 3 metals, that is, potassium, calcium, sodium and aluminium. By and large, feldpsars can be further divided into alkali feldspars (or K-spars, in shorthand) and plagioclase feldspars, both of which play extremely important roles in giving granite its distinctive texture. \r The K-spars are the flamboyant components of granite, as they are responsible for giving granite its varied colours. Granites take on colours ranging from red to grey to blue to pink to yellow, and this range of colours are single-handedly supplied by the K-spars. Visually, they present themselves as the highly-coloured, opaque patches in the granite and their presence gives granite its aesthetic value. \r The plagioclase feldspars, named from the Greek plagio- meaning oblique and  -clase meaning cleavage, referring to the minerals\u2019 fine parallel striations, are the other sort of feldspars occurring in granite. They present themselves visually as the milky to cream white components of the granite structure. In polished granite, these minerals also contribute to the shine of the rock as they flash a brilliant white at very particular angles of light.     Accessory minerals: Granite is often graced by the presence of dark coloured minerals that add the variety to its already nicely patterned surface. These dark coloured minerals are usually from the hornblende family of minerals or biotite. These minerals present themselves as sprinkles across the lighter surface of granite, looking like grains of pepper against a white background. \r Together, the components of granite form the distinctive grainy pattern of granite that is highly prized by builders and decorators worldwide. The diagram below shows the surface texture of a typical granite rock. Try to identify the different components of the rock as practice before heading out to the field.     Granite in Singapore \r Granite plays an extremely important role in the geology of Singapore. The largest geological formation in Singapore in the Bukit Timah Granite and this formation is the bedrock for most of the main island and one of its largest islands, Pulau Ubin. The central outcrop, which is located primarily within the Nature Reserves (which of course, includes its namesake Bukit Timah Nature Reserve) measures 8 kilometres across by 7 kilometres from north to south. It is responsible for some of the highest (above sea level) parts in Singapore, like Bukit Timah and Bukit Batok. Granite was extensive quarried form these sites and Pulau Ubin from as early as the 19th century up to the late 20th century, leaving picturesque water-filled quarries once the mining operations ceased.  The map below shows the location of the Bukit Timah granite outcrops in Singapore.    \r In The Biophysical Environment of Singapore (1991), G. S. P. Thomas described the Bukit Timah granite as follows:  \u201cThe dominant, granitic component is grey and medium grained and consists of cream to pale yellow feldspar, smoky quartz and smaller proportions of biotite and dark hornblende\u201d \r According to historical records, the granite of Singapore was used extensively in the building projects of the colonial era, most famously, in the construction of the offshore lighthouses like that on Pedra Branca, and the Johor-Singapore causeway. Subsequently, locally quarried granite was also used in the construction of some of the earliest HDB blocks and roads, but most of the quarry works ceased in the late 20th century when construction materials were imported from neighbouring countries instead.  The Tasks \r Now that you have learnt about granite, it\u2019s time to put that knowledge to the test:  Examine the rock that the Cenotaph is made out of. Describe the rock in terms of texture and colour. The rock is NOT of a single colour! Try to describe the all the colours as best you can. Determine, based on the description of Bukit Timah Granite provided, whether the granite you see here were locally quarried or imported from elsewhere. Please cite reasons for your answer, making reference to the description provided and your observations. Optional: Photographs of the area of you or your GPS in the area will be appreciated. Try not to give too much information for the previous tasks in the photos.  Final Notes \r Please e-mail the answers to the questions above to me. Photologs as the sole proof of visit to the site will not be entertained. You must make some attempt at answering the questions. Do not worry about being incorrect, as long as you have made your best effort at answering the questions, your log will be accepted. \r The cache is accessible from Esplanade MRT (CC3) or City Hall MRT (NS25\/EW13) via Citylink Mall. You may also choose to walk at street level, which will provide you with plenty more sights of the Civic District.  \r This is a historical marker dedicated to the dark period of history. Please be mindful of its past and behave respectfully in the vicinity of the memorial. Do not scratch the stones making up the memorial in any way, as it is not required for the tasks.

Like the Sirens of the Homer\u2019s Odyssey, she has a voice so beautiful, all who hear could not help but be mesmerised by it. Those who have heard her sing can never forget her song, and while this would normally be a great talent, it would be the bane of her existence. Eliala was burdened by being the sole witness of the murder a man named Li Thaat. The perpetrators of the crime were a group of people known as the Puhnee, who were relentless in their pursuit of silencing her permanently so that she would not speak of what she saw. Eliala was put under a witness protection programme by the local authorities, but no matter where they hid her, she would always be found because of her gift. She would sing to herself when she was bored, and when her voice drifted through the walls and out the windows, everyone would know where she was, and word spread quickly. She was moved from location to location, but every single time, she would be discovered when she sang. She tried to keep her voice concealed \u2013 by singing only during a storm, for instance, but even the strongest winds and fiercest gales would calm when her melody fills the air. And so, Eliala was condemned to a never-ending journey. Whenever she was compelled to use her gift, it meant that her life in her current home was shattered for good, and she would have to move to another corner of this wide world. She would go on many adventures, and one of them took place here, in Singapore. It is now your task, my dear explorer, to uncover the story of Eliala Mei-Ning in Singapore.

Join us at the Esplanade Rooftop on Saturday morning for a casual meet with experienced and budding COs. I, and a number of other far more experienced and well-regarded COs, will be happy to sort out any curiosities or uncertainties you might have about designing, hiding and maintaining geocaches in Singapore, a place where geocaches generally lead a hard life of trying to evade detection and removal by our extremely hardworking janitorial and public maintenance workers... or simply trying to stay dry while exposed to the harshest of tropical elements.  Who's this for?  Aspiring or budding COs who need guidance on the technicalities of preparing a cache hide and\/or a cache listing on the Geocaching website. Experienced or veteran COs who need a little inspiration to elevate their cache hiding game, or who'd like to share their experience and expertise with the community.

Inspire fellow aspiring and budding COs through success stories of audacious urban hides or unexpectedly enormous containers in our urban jungle.     Cache Ownership How-to Experienced COs will be sharing with participants about:  official cache hiding guidelines; local (Singapore) cache placement guidelines and regulations; special cache types, such as Mystery, Earthcache and Letterbox Hybrid caches; and tips and tricks.      Mini-game: How would you hide this? Stand a chance to win some Geocaching goodies, including containers, SWAG and perhaps even a trackable item!

This cache commemorates this achievement, and is located at a historic food centre in the heart of the city: Maxwell Food Centre.   The Sign Above the Entrance (which is still there today!) This structure you see today began its life as the Maxwell Road Market in 1929 to help to centralise the street hawkers who would peddle their goods in Chinatown's narrow streets. Rather amusingly, rather than pay the rental to set up shop within, many hawkers decided to peddle their goods around the building, and the authorities were caught blindsided by this. After some deliberation, it was decided that the interior of the market be used for the placement of cooked food stalls, along with tables and chairs for dining and entertainment stages for operas and getais (performances during the Hungry Ghost Festival). Thus, the Maxwell Food Centre found its humble origins.  During the Japanese Occupation, the market continued in its role of providing for the Chinatown community, with rental reduced to once again try to entice vendors to set up shop within. Goods sold were rationed and sold at fixed prices as per the practice during wartime. After the war, the returning British government set up a \"Family Restaurant\" within the market, which sold food at a fixed low price to families who were in need and displaced after the war.  Yet, the fight to keep the Market viable continued as hawkers continued to set up shop outside the building instead of within. After decades of the government tussling with the hawkers to get them to move inside, the market was finally fully occupied in 1972 when the famous Telok Ayer Market (today's Lau Pa Sat) was closed down for redevelopment and its vendors moved into this Market. At this point, the Market was a mix of fresh produce stores and food stalls, much like many of the wet markets in the heartlands today,   The Rather Empty Market in 1986 It was in 1986, after the stalls from the Lau Pa Sat moved out, that the government decided to convert the Market to a dedicated Food Centre by moving the hawkers from the streets around China Square, down the road, into the market. Many of the stalls in the Food Centre trace their roots to those once set up at China Square, a legacy preserved in some of their names.   Maxwell Food Centre in 1992 The Food Centre was nearly demolished when URA decided to move its headquaters into the area, but the push to conserve a heritage building  prevailed, and after redevelopment in the 2000s, the Food Centre we know and love today took shape. Today, Maxwell Food Centre has become an icon in its own right, of course, with famous chefs and online personalities heaping praises on the food sold here, so there's no excuse not to grab a bite or a drink after getting the cache. Hawkers in the city have been hit especially hard during the last two years owing to lower footfall due to Work From Home requirements for many companies in the Central Business District, so do support our hawkers and the intangible heritage they embody!     Maxwell Food Centre (before the Pandemic, of course) Happy hunting, and enjoy the location!

Excitedly, I switched the over to another application on my mobile phone. I flicked the phone screen a few times, and the task was accomplished. A new one for the collection! It was about 10 pm at Newton Circus Hawker Centre, we had just finished a huge ops and Singapore was covered in a virtual sea of blue. It was a triumph, and we had settled for a celebratory supper. Not sure how I got dragged into this\u2026 just earlier I was at Botanic Gardens catching Voltorbs and Clefairies with another group of friends, and then, a meeting at Adam Road Hawker Centre to take down some portals, and now, staring down a rare creature with some other trainers. There was a gym nearby, but it was just out of reach because we chose a table that\u2019s a bit too far from the entrance. Hacking the portal was not an option either, unless there was a lucky bit of GPS drift. I reflected on the past few weeks: it\u2019s been a whirlwind, a mad adventure. Walking, hacking, capturing. The world and the people in it has changed\u2026 and things were only going to get more interesting. An alert appeared on the Comms. I glanced at it, hoping it was not someone trying to take down my portals back in Toa Payoh. Nope, but it was a very odd message: \u201cHELP, HELP\u2026\u201d it began. I checked if I knew the IGN. No, not anyone I knew.  It continued, \u201c\u2026Resist the Wartortle Complexity!\u201d I was genuinely confused. Could it be that someone was playing a prank on me? Perhaps it was just a cryptic message intended for someone else. Ignoring it, I walked off to order a glass of sugarcane juice. Returning to the table, the same message repeated itself on the Comms, this time directed at my own IGN. I replied, \u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201d I waited, and there was no reply.  Then, my phone vibrated again. I looked at it, and there was a message\u2026 in the Geocaching Message Centre. It was from a geocacher named ThePersian and it read \u201cPeaceful, Pure Venusaur\u201d. Two nonsensical messages in the span of one hour. I was really unsure of what it meant, but I was too sleepy to make anything of it, and plus, someone just placed a fracker at the nearby portal, so I was off to go do some more hacking.   The mystery remains unresolved. I received no further messages after that fateful night, but every once in a while, I look back at them, and wonder whether they will ever lead to anything\u2026 ","hint":"puzzle: it's difficult to stop the march of po-gress.cache: on \"tangela\"","total_found":"16","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":345646,"code":"GCTCET","name":"Ba-Gua (8 Trigram)","geocacheType":8,"containerType":8,"difficulty":3.0,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":3,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.374683,"longitude":103.896933,"ownerId":"PRZT11","ownerName":"zeng","placedDate":"2006-02-09","lastFoundDate":"2023-02-17","lastFoundTime":"20:36:14","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GCTCET","description":" Important: The Cache\r is not at the above Co-Ordinate, it will lead you to a nearby\r carpark.

These sediments mainly come from the weathering and erosion of rocks and occasionally the shells and remains of living organisms. Over time, pressure and\/or chemical reactions will convert these sediments into tougher material; creating the entire class of rocks we call sedimentary rocks. \r A distinguishing feature of sedimentary rocks as a whole is that they tend to form horizontal bands in their formation, which is known as bedding. These beds can be a few millimetres to a few metres thick, depending on how the material was deposited. These beds tell us the sequence of deposition of material, since different materials, originating from different times and places will have different properties and colours. The type of sedimentary rocks also changes across the beds, with sandstones alternating with conglomerates and siltstone in the same area, testament to the changing geography of the area over time.  Example of Bedding in Sedimentary Rocks Sedimentary rocks cover most of Earth\u2019s surface, but the only constitute a small volume of the Earth\u2019s crust (less than 10%). This is because sedimentary rocks form very close to the surface of the Earth, and tectonic movement will push these rocks upwards. Sedimentary rocks are immensely important in palaeontology (the study of life on Earth before the emergence of humans) as they are the type of rocks most likely to contain the fossils of dinosaurs. In addition, they tend to contain valuable information about the physical geography of an area in the past.  Areas containing deposits of limestone, for instance would indicate that the area was once at the bottom of the sea, before being pushed up by tectonic movements.  \r   Types of Sedimentary Rocks Sedimentary rocks are further subdivided into groups, depending on the processes and substances that form them, so let us examine them in turn.  Clastic sedimentary rocks \r Clastic rocks are named so as they are made of clasts, that is, weathered or eroded rock material that have been cemented together. These rocks are the most varied of the sedimentary and their identity depends on the size of the clasts that make them up. In order of the largest to smallest clasts, they are named as follows:  Conglomerates: These rocks are made up of gravel (pebbles of size of a millimetre or more) cemented together to form a larger rock. They are easily identified by the fact that they are made up of a patchwork of other rounded rocks, of various colours and origin.  Conglomerate rock Breccias: These guys are the cousins of conglomerates. They, too, are made up of gravel measuring a few millimetres of more, usually originating from a landslide of some sort. They differ from conglomerates in the sense that breccias are made up of more angular, less weathered pebbles while conglomerate are made up of more rounded, more weather pebbles.  Sandstones: Sandstones, as their name suggests, are made up of sand grains cemented together to form a tough rock. Don\u2019t let their composition fool you; sandstones are a fairly tough rock, a few times harder than concrete. They present themselves in beautiful bright colours, from white to orange to red.  They form some of the most beautiful geological formations, including the many canyons of the American West, such as the Grand Canyon. Sandstone can be identified by their sand sized grain, which is smaller than that of a pebble, but still big enough to be seen by the naked eye.   Sandstone rocks at Antelope Canyon, Arizona Mudstones, Claystones and Siltstones: Like sandstones, these rocks also present themselves in a multitude of colours. They are so named because they are made out of silt and clay particles, which are almost too small to make out with the naked eye. Claystones contain more clay, siltstones contain more silt and mudstones are somewhere in the middle. In the field, it is quite difficult to distinguish between them, so, here we will classify them as one.    Mudstone Sample Shale: is a specific form of mudstone, identified from the fact that it breaks into thin parallel layers when the rock undergoes layering  Biochemical Sedimentary Rocks \r Biochemical rocks are rocks made from the remains of living organisms, such as corals and molluscs (shellfish). These organisms take in calcium from the sea water to make calcium carbonate, which is the primary composition of the corals and seashells. Over time, as these creatures die, their remnants form sediments at the bottom of oceans, and with pressure, the sediments form rocks made out of calcium carbonate, which we call limestone. Other plant and animal material will lead to the formation of rocks like the carbon-rich coal or even petroleum and natural gas (but the last two are no longer rocks)  Chemical Sedimentary Rocks\r Chemical rocks are rocks made simply from the deposition of minerals and salts that have precipitated from water. These are the rocks salts that have names like halite and gypsum.\r   The Sedimentary Rocks of Singapore A large part of the western and southern part of Singapore (including the Southern Islands like St. John\u2019s, Lazarus, Jurong Island and Sentosa) are made up of sedimentary rocks which form a larger formation of rocks collectively known as the Jurong Formation. These rocks from the backbone of the Southern Ridges (stretching from Kent Ridge to Mount Faber), the hills that form Sentosa Island (Serapong, Imbiah and Siloso) and the cliffs of Labrador Park. The Jurong Formation is made of a myriad of sedimentary rocks, namely siltstone, mudstone, limestone, shale, conglomerate and sandstone. The sea cliffs of Siloso Point are made up of a number of these sedimentary rocks of differing colours and type.  Geological Map of Singapore. Jurong Formation is the white area covering most of southern and western Singapore Here, at Siloso Point, you will be examining a range of rocks from this ensemble, and identifying them. To aid you in your tasks, I have specially prepared a diagram (called a dichotomous key) to help you identify the types of rock in the Jurong Formation. It takes the form of a flowchart, beginning from the left, where you have to answer a series of questions to choose the next path in the diagram. At the end of the path, you would have found the identity of your rock.  Dichotomous key for the identification of sedimentary rocks in Singapore The Earthcache Tasks (Note: The waypoints are numbered from East to West, from Underwater World Sentosa to the tip of Siloso Point)  At WP 1 and WP 3, you will observe outcrops of stones of a dark colour. Describe these stones according to the dichotomous key and, hence, identify these stones. At WP 2, you will observe light coloured stones with a beautiful pattern at your feet. Describe these stones according to the key and identify them. In addition, suggest a reason for the patterns of the stone. Read the listing closely, and you\u2019ll find the reason At WP 4 and 5, you will see a pinkish coloured stone outcrops made of a combination of two types of stones. Identify both types of stones, and tell me the reasons why you proposed these identities. Optional: Feel free to log pictures of the flora and fauna along the coastline, and the view from the coast. You are exploring one of Singapore\u2019s very last rocky shores, a habitat that can only be found in only two or three other places in this nation thanks to extensive land reclamation which creates artificial coastlines. Please DO NOT post close-up pictures of the rocks, as this will potentially give away the answers to the above three tasks.    \r You are to email me the answer to all three tasks above. Photologs as sole proof of visit is insufficient, and logs that are not accompanied with an email with the answers will be deleted.\r   Important Field Notes  The route to this cache is tidal, which means that it can only be accessed at low tides. Any low tide below 1.0 metres will suffice as I explored the coast with a tide of 0.8 metres when I researched for this cache. Do not get caught out by the tide, or you will end up doing a little wading. This cache is along one of the routes to \u201cCliffhanger (Tidal Cache)\u201d (http:\/\/coord.info\/GCXYR8). You may combine this cache with an expedition to that one. In fact, WP5 is just no more than 100 metres from that cache. Some of the rocks may be slippery when wet. Exercise caution when attempting this cache, try not to do this cache alone, wear good shoes and bring a hiking pole, if required. The area is home to a sensitive ecosystem and an increasingly rare habitat in Singapore. Please do not fish, disturb any creatures in the area, litter or damage the area in any way. Also, no swimming is allowed! Stepping in the water is potentially dangerous as stonefish and jellyfish may be lurking in the waters. They are positively nasty to come into contact with. The closest car parking lot is at Underwater World Sentosa, where you can begin the hike to the cache almost immediately. For those who are not driving, you may take Bus Route 1 and 2 from almost any part of the island. Good starting points would be Beach Station, the Merlion or even Resorts World Sentosa. You are to alight at the Siloso Point bus stop.    Good luck Earthcaching, and stay safe!

About This Adventure Lab Cache Welcome to an Adventure across Chinatown and a journey back to our communal roots. In this series, we will explore the rich cultural history of the Chinese Clan Associations who aided our ancestors when they first arrived on this foreign island. There are five locations in this Adventure on a two-kilometre trail that winds its way around the beautiful heritage precincts of Chinatown. Much of Singapore's early development were built on the foundations of these Clan Associations. When the first Chinese immigrants arrived here, they were in need of support in many ways: lodgings, jobs, education and even religious obligations. Clan associations based on kinship, dialect groups or vocation were set up by the pioneers to help provide these needs. Thus, many of the earliest temples, schools and hospitals were set up by clans for their fellow men. Many of the clans have survive to this day, and we shall explore their rich heritage in this Adventure Lab.  The Final Cache To get the coordinates for the final cache, use the information in the Journal Entries to solve the simple puzzle below:  You'll find the cache near another historic building that was also built by the Chinese clans to give thanks for a safe voyage to Singapore.

On the 9th of August, 2021, Singapore marked her 56th year of independence. This day each year is known simply as National Day, a day when the National Day Parade (NDP) is traditionally held in city centre locations such as the Padang, the former National Stadium, and more recently The Float @ Marina Bay. 2021's parade was the last one held on The Float @ Marina Bay before the venue's planned redevelopment. 2021 also marked the first time in history that circumstances had forced a postponement of (the bulk of) the NDP in light of unfortunate developments in the country's COVID-19 situation and tightening of control measures until mid-August.  The lyrics in the title and the top of the listing are of the chorus of this year's NDP theme song, The Road Ahead. Put together by singer-songwriter Linying and producer Evan Low, it was evidently greatly inspired by the struggles of the past year and a half, and perhaps coincidentally an even more appropriate song to theme the first NDP that had to be postponed due to challenging circumstances.   National Day Songs! Anyone growing up in Singapore in her most formative years will remember the countless theme songs that accompanied each year\u2019s National Day festivities. From the highly catchy Stand Up for Singapore (1984) to the emotive Home (1998), these timeless tunes will continue to remind Singaporeans of NDPs through the years. Take a nostalgic trip through some of our picks, from the pre-2000s singalongs (and their refreshing new remakes), to the elaborate modern pieces of today and the past decade.

About This Adventure Lab Cache Welcome to an Adventure Lab that will take you down Telok Ayer Street, one of the oldest streets in the modern Singapore, and the cradle of the \u201cChinatown\u201d you see around you today. The road is notable for its historic buildings, many of which have histories that date back to the founding of Singapore. Telok Ayer means \u201cWater Bay\u201d in Malay, named for the street\u2019s original function, which was a place where ships could stock up on fresh water from the wells at the foot of nearby Ann Siang Hill. The shape of the street, which forms a wide arc in the otherwise grid layout of the city, is the only surviving vestige of its coastal past. Stamford Raffles designated the south bank of the Singapore River as the enclave for the immigrants. Hence, in the years after 1819, Telok Ayer, being a natural harbour, was where many of our forefathers first set foot on Singapore after their long journeys. Religious buildings and clan associations sprung up along the street, and will be the subjects of this AL. The Final Cache To get the location of this cache, check the journal entries for the first four waypoints of the Adventure Lab. You will also get a hint for the cache's hiding spot at the last waypoint's journal entry.","hint":"cache: it's under-cover?","total_found":"19","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8384010,"code":"GC9G71W","name":"A Trilogy in Time and Space: World Enough & Time","geocacheType":8,"containerType":3,"difficulty":2.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":1,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.302833,"longitude":103.872383,"ownerId":"PR6064Y","ownerName":"ZacharyKZH","placedDate":"2021-09-09","lastFoundDate":"2022-09-17","lastFoundTime":"12:00:00","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9G71W","description":"Welcome to a loosely-related series of puzzles based on space and time, two fundamental concepts in our understanding of the world and the universe!

This puzzle is based on SCP-3001, and though you need not have to read it to solve the puzzle, it will help with understanding some of the context of the story. Acknowledgements: \"SCP-3001\" by OZ Ouroboros, from the SCP Wiki. Licensed under CC-BY-SA.  Authenticating Credentials\u2026   Access Granted.   Welcome to the SCP Foundation Database   Accessing File \u201cSCP-3001-SG\u201d\u2026  Item #: SCP-3001-SG Object Class: Euclid Special Containment Procedures: Local field agents are to continuously monitor the area around N001 18.170 E 103 52.343, hereafter referred to as SCP-3001-SG-A, for any anomalous space-time distortions. Distortions are, but not limited to, sudden teleportation of objects into or away from SCP-3001-SG-A, time contraction and dilation and spatial distortion. Any anomalous incidents are to be reported immediately to Head of Site-120, Dr. Anna Lang. Witnesses to any anomalous incidents are to be given Class-B Amnestics. Objects or entities that have appeared due to teleportation events are to be secured immediately by field agents or mobile task force (whichever deemed more applicable) and brought to Site-120 for examination and analysis. Description: SCP-3001-SG is hypothesized to be a \u201cpocket (non)-dimension\u201d and an associated wormhole that were believed to have somehow been created in conjunction with the events of SCP-3001. It is unclear how the two are linked, but the simultaneous nature of occurrence of events between SCP-3001 and SCP-3001-SG point to a yet to be explained relationship between them. To date, there have been two documented anomalous events caused by SCP-3001-SG, designated Event SCP-3001-SG-1 and SCP-3001-SG-2 respectively, amd both appear linked to the placement of a one-metre long time capsule, designated SCP-3001-SG-3. Event SCP-3001-SG-1 Event was documented on December 23 2005, at Site SCP-3001-SG-A, near the western entrance of the soon-to-be-demolished National Stadium. The anomaly is believed to be associated with the presence of SCP-3001-SG-3, which is believed to be buried at the site. Witnesses reported spatial and time distortions, such as the stadium stairs becoming non-Euclidean (e.g. those walking up the stairs found themselves at the bottom of the stairs again). Time distortions include a nearby clock array, showing the times in Southeast Asian cities having some of their times having moved randomly forwards, backwards, or not at all (see Figure 1). Oddly enough, the clock showing the local time in Singapore was unaffected. Special containment procedures were executed as per protocol. Figure 1 The event is associated with the presence, and, as later discovered by the Singapore authorities, the disappearance of SCP-3001-SG-3, a copper time capsule placed in conjunction with the construction of the National Stadium on February 23 1970 by then Minister of Finance, Goh Keng Swee. SCP-3001-SG-3 (see Figure 2) is a sealed time capsule that contained newspaper articles, coins and other sports-related memorabilia. It was believed to be placed under the foundation stone of the stadium.  Figure 2 (from the National Archives of Singapore) In 2007, local authorities searched for SCP-3001-SG-3 to no avail during the demolition of the old National Stadium to pave the way for the new Sports Hub, and the local field agents were alerted of the disappearance. After three years of searching SCP-3001-SG-A, the hunt for SCP-3001-SG-3 was called off, and presumed lost for good. While the Foundation is certain that the disappearance is related to Event SCP-3001-SG-1, a cover story offering several alternate theories of the disappearance was fed to the public, which included that SCP-3001-SG-3 was dug up during the construction of a fountain, or that it had sunk into the soft ground. Event SCP-3001-SG-2 Event was documented on September 9 2021, once again centered on SCP-3001-SG-A and coinciding with an experimental attempt to reopen the original SCP-3001 at Site-120. Similar spatial and temporal distortions were witnessed, but this time, they were distributed over a 2-kilometer radius around SCP-3001-SG-A. However, effects were generally milder, possibly due to the dispersed nature of the event. It is noteworthy that a new time capsule, now designated SCP-3001-SG-4 (see Figure 3) has been buried at the site. Whether it has disappeared, like its older counterpart, remains to be determined.  Figure 3 Foundation Researchers speculate that SCP-3001-SG-3 may have reemerged from SCP-3001-SG during this event, perhaps cause by some form of displacement event in space and time, but have been unable to locate any trace of it as of time of writing. Measurements of the Hume Field in the vicinity after Event SCP-3001-SG-2 indicates that this is highly likely, and efforts on underway by specially-trained field agents (codenamed \u201cGeocachers\u201d) to locate it. Agents are currently reviewing the data collected from Event SCP-3001-SG-1 for clues to its location. Addenda: If and when SCP-3001-SG-3 is located, please report your find in a log below and inform the CO (Commanding Officer) for the Singapore Foundation branch immediately. Do not attempt to remove SCP-3001-SG-3 from its location without permission. Agents who violate protocol will be terminated with immediate effect.

Since he came to Singapore 5 years ago, he has been obsessed with hawker food. After his first visit to Old Airport Road Food Centre on 19 Sep 2011, he set himself on a mission to eat at least one meal in every public hawker centre in Singapore, keeping a detailed log of each visit. On 19 Aug 2016, he made his 108th and final eating stop at the Eunos Food Centre. 50 of his friends came along for dinner and to congratulate him of this extraordinary mission, and in many ways, a uniquely Singapore record. \r If you are interested in more records of Singapore, go and visit this site.

Much time was spent identifying this precise location which has special secret family significance.    On the 22nd of September 2013, Singapore hosted it's 6th F1 race (race 13 of 19 of the 2013 season). The reigning F1 World Champion Sebastian Vettel (#1) (GERMANY) and his teammate Mark Webber (#2) (AUSTRALIA) raced the RB9 Red Bull - Renault Formula 1.   The 5.065km \/ 3.147mile lap winds through the streets of downtown Singapore and around the edge of Marina Bay Harbour and the 22 drivers of the 11 teams raced 61 laps under lights at speeds too high to permit them the pleasure of enjoying the amazing scenery.   Sebastian dominated the weekend, taking the Pole Position with a 1minute 42.841s lap in Qualifying,  Fastest Lap of the race - 1min48.574 and the race victory.  Mark started the race from 4th position on the grid and was running in 3rd place towards the end of the race however suffered a water leak which caused his car to overheat on the last lap, resulting in him not finishing the race (DNF).   Both drivers experienced controversies - Sebastian being booed on the podium and Mark being penalised for running back onto the track and hitching a ride back to the pits on the side of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari during the slow down lap.

Crawling through tunnels, exploring hidden bunkers and climbing up ladders... these are some of the otherwise unthinkable things I have done in the name of finding that next amazing cache.   Singapore has its own selection of caches in abandoned buildings. Forgotten palaces, the old WWII batteries and bunkers, lost railway lines, and even the occasional dark and scary tunnel. I hope that this challenge will motivate you to go try out some of these caches and live a geocaching life that is on the wilder side. So, are you game? If you are, here is what you need to do: Find at least 13 caches which have the \"Abandoned Building\" attribute. The attribute icon looks like this:   Caches of all types with the attribute will be counted. The caches can be both in and out of Singapore, and both active and inactive caches will be considered. As with all challenge caches, if you do not meet the criteria, your log will be deleted. But, I am sure all of you cachers have integrity, and I will not have to do anything as nasty as that. You can check if you have fulfilled the challenge here:  The cache is located at the Imbiah Battery, located on one of the three highest points of Sentosa Island (formerly known as Pulau Blakang Mati). The battery is one of the 4 coastal defence structures that protected the Western entrance to Keppel Harbour in the years before WWII. The other defences in the area (Siloso, Labrador and Batu Berlayer) already have caches placed near or on them, so this cache \"completes\" the set. Imbiah Battery had 3 9.2-inch guns, along with all the usual accoutrements of a coastal battery: ammo reccesses, an ammo hoist, a magazine, shelters and position finding cells.

Kangkar Village In the 1970s and 80s, residents who lived in Punggol referred to the settlement at the end of the old Upper Serangoon Road as Kangkar (\"foot of the river\" in Teochew), referring to Sungai Serangooon (Serangoon River). It was a bustling seaport, known for its wholesale fish market, one of the largest in the North Eastern part of Singapore.  Subsequently with urban redevelopment, part of the Serangoon River was reclaimed and the villagers of Kangkar resettled to new housing estates, with many residing in nearby Hougang.  Upper Serangoon Road was also extended to the new sengkang estate.  Although villagers miss the neighbourly spirit of kampong life, many welcomed the move to new housing estates as the houses are cleaner and safer.  It was common for the Kangkar houses to flood when the tide was higher than usual. Sometimes flood water brought snakes into the house. Children and ladies scrambled to stand on tables and chairs while the men threw shoes and attacked with poles to chase them out.  Household appliances got rusty easily and broke down much faster.

The Prime Minister, a Mr Lee Kuan Yew, steps up at the microphones in front of a crowd of supporters and onlookers outside Gate 1 of the counting station. The man in white, reportedly with tears welling in his eyes, says: \"This verdict is decisive. It is the seal of public and popular approval for the merger and Malaysia... ...We are off to a good start\"  The 1962 Referendum for the Merger of Singapore into the Federation of Malaysia is, while not without controversy, one of the important milestones in Singapore's history. This cache brings you to the location where the announcement that Singapore will be merging to form a new country was made more than half a century ago, marking the first step to independence. Welcome to the Former Singapore Badminton Stadium! The History of the Stadium The year is 1949: the combined Singapore and Malaya team had just won the Thomas Cup, the most prestigious badminton tournament at the time. With the glory of being the champion of a sport popularised by the British in their colonies, the nations had a problem: along with the trophy, they had also earned the right to host the next tournament. Neither countries had the facilities to host a tournament of this scale... and so, the decision was made to build a new Badminton Stadium.  The site was chosen to be along Guillemard Road, in Geylang, close to the airport. But, the cost of builidng a new Hall was astronomical for the time - ballooning to $800,000 by the end of the construction. Donations from the public only amounted to $32,000, It was only with the help of a loan from Aw Boon Haw (one of the brothers of Haw Par Villa and Tiger Balm fame), and the contractor absorbing some of the excess costs, that the project could be completed.  Even then, the Hall was not completed in time by the 1952 Thomas Cup in May, which was played at the Happy World Stadium instead. They had just missed the deadline, and the Hall was only opened in June 1952 by Sir John Nicoll, the then Governor of Singapore (and the man Nicoll Highway is named after). Luckily, the effort was not going to waste, as the home team also won the 1952 Thomas Cup, and earned the right to host the 1955 Tournament, which was, at last, held at the brand new Hall. The Hall would go on to also host the 1958 tournament after the home team won again in 1955, but eventually the streak was broken by the Indonesians. The Hall would go on to host other Badminton tournaments in the coming decades, including a few SEA Games, until its eventual closure as a sports facility in 2007.  Beyond Badminton  The Hall was not only used for sports, as it hosted community variety shows featuring Rose Chan and P. Ramlee, among other celebrities. It even hosted a Rolling Stones concert in 1965 where an over-excited crowd caused the collapse of a temporary wall erected for the event.  However, the Hall also had its place in political history as it was used a counting station for General Elections such as the 1959 Elections, and most prominently, the 1962 Merger Referendum. As such, it was also a place of great buzz during these periods, and politicians and parties would make their victory speeches at this venue to crowds overflowing onto the streets.  The Present  These days, there are no longer crowds watching badminton at the Hall. The space has been leased on to various companies, such as cafes, a rock climbing facility and gyms. Given Singapore's penchant for replacing old buildings, the Hall has been extremely lucky to survive relatively intact with minimal changes to its facade. It's been recognised as a Historical Site by the NHB but it is not declared a National Monument, so it may not be conserved and\/or preserved in the future. So, step into these hallowed halls while you still can and remember a piece of early modern Singapore history  The Cache You'll find the cache just outside the building in the public car park. It should be accessible 24\/7, though try not to visit during the wee hours of the night. Be stealthy, and please take good care of the cache.

It\r beamed down an object. Alex, at\r Cosy Bay (GCRJGF) observes that the\r flying saucer on a True Bearing of 22\u00ba 4.183\u2019 from his\r position. At the same\r time, Ben at Bintan Trail (GC93B3)\r observes that the flying saucer on a True Bearing of 294\u00ba\r 58.964\u2019 from his position. (True Bearings\r are directional observations measured from Geographical North, also\r known as True North, in clockwise direction. e.g. North is 0\u00ba, East is 90\u00ba, South is 180\u00ba, West is\r 270\u00ba) Before Alex and\r Ben could raise the alert, the flying sauce disappeared into the\r night sky leaving nothing except for the object and observations of\r Alex and Ben. Alex and Ben\r wanted to find the object. \u201cLuckily,\r our positions are not too far apart. We could take our region of\r the earth as a plane and solve the location of the alien object by\r geometrical method. Remember, the Golden Triangle case\r (GCE082)?\u201d said Ben to Alex when they meet the next\r day.\r Ben and Alex start to work immediately with charts, protractor and\r ruler, drawing straights lines from Cosy Bay and Bintan\r Trail. Try as they\r may, Alex and Ben could not lay their hands on a protractor that\r measure better that 0.5 of a degree. Slowly, they begin to realize\r that looking for the object may be a little more difficult than\r they thought. \u201cWhy are\r you grinning, Ken\u201d said Alex to his teenage son, noticing for\r the first time his son is watching him with the widest smile on his\r face. \u201cDad,\r would you reward me with an iPod if I\r help to solved the problem?\u201d said Ken. \u201cOK, give it a\r try\u201d said Alex, already at his wits end. \u201cIf you\r represent the Longitude with X and the Latitude with\r Y. Then the\r straight lines you have drawn on the charts could be converted to 2\r linear equations. The intersection of the lines is just the\r solution of the 2 simultaneous equations. With calculator you could\r achieve any accuracy you wanted without been constrained by\r protractors\u201d said Ken. \u201cAh!!\u201d\r exclaimed Alex and Ben, suddenly seeing the light. Ken collected\r his reward and headed for Sim Lim\r Square. Alex and Ben\r were still punching on the calculator and scribbling the X\u2019s\r & Y\u2019s on paper, when Ken returned sporting his brand-new\r iPod. \u201cDad, you\r should consider buying me a note-book computer for my school work.\r Besides, it is useful for you\r too.

By Sentosa Express: Alight at Imbiah Station By Public Bus: Board Bus 123 and alight at Village Hotel By Intra-Island Bus: Board Sentosa Bus A or C and alight at Imbiah Lookout By Cable Car: Board the cable car from HarbourFront Tower 2 or Mount Faber Station and alight at Imbiah Sentosa Cable Car Station   Upon reaching Sentosa Nature Discovery, take the stairs to level 1 where you will find the Geology Gallery, which details the geological history of Sentosa Island, and is the subject of this Earthcache.  <The above is an image of the Geology Gallery at Sentosa Nature Discovery.> The Geology of Sentosa Island The Southern Islands (in which Sentosa Island is part of) are formed from part of a large sedimentary rock group deposited during the Mesozoic era (250 to 65 million years ago). There are two distinct parts of the deposit, known as the Jurong Group and the Sentosa Group, based on the time period in which they were formed. The latter forms the bedrock of the Southern Islands, and will be the focus of this Earthcache. The Sentosa Group, which was deposited in the Upper Triassic Period is further subdivided into the Tanjong Rimau Formation (the cape at the north-western tip of Sentosa) and Fort Siloso Formation, named for the location of the type specimen used to classify the rocks.   There is much that can be said about the formation and types of sedimentary rocks, but we won\u2019t go into exhaustive detail here. For this cache, only a few key points are of relevance:  The rocks of the Sentosa Group are clastic sedimentary rocks, which means that they are made from the weathered remnants of other rocks that has been eroded, transported and deposited by natural elements.  The grain size of the sedimentary rock, which is the size and shape of the pieces of original rock\/minerals (i.e. clasts) making up the rock, determines the identity of the rock.   The largest-grained sedimentary rocks, conglomerate, are made out of a mixture of sand and gravel. They are generally larger than 2mm in diameter and visible to the eye. These look like composite rocks cemented together, and some of the original rocks' character, like colour and texture can still be made out. As the grain becomes smaller, the rock transitions to sandstone, which are made up sand-sized grains. The grains feel rough to the touch, and have diameters between 62.5 to 2000 micrometers.  Even smaller grained rocks are the mudstones, which are made from very fine clay particles, which are between 4 to 62.5 micrometers. These look like lumps of unbaked clay, or the surface of unglazed pottery.  Lastly, we have our tinest claystones, which are made up of even smaller clay sediments of smaller than 4 micrometers in diameter and can't be seen with the naked eye.   The presence of each of the above types of rocks tell a story of the environment that they were deposited in.   Larger-grains rocks tend to be deposited in river (or fluvial) environments which has enough flow and energy to transport large pebbles.  Smaller grain rocks tend to be deposited in lakes (or lacustrine) and meandering river environments where the flow has slowed down sufficiently for the grains to be deposited. The smallest grain rocks tend to be found in river deltas (or deltaic) and sea (or marine) environments, where the water has nearly lost all its forward momentum.   Finally, the colour of the rock paints a picture of the mineral composition of the rock. The mineral composition will not be a focus of this EC, but will serve as an important identifier of the formation the rock belongs to.   With the key characteristics of the rocks laid out, let us turn to the two formations that we will be examining in the Earthcache: the Tanjong Rimau Formation and the Fort Siloso Formation. These two formations are exposed to various extents on Southern Islands, and will form the backdrop to the rest of the geological structures and phenomena you will observe on these islands.  Earthcache Tasks Task 1: Observe and get to know more about the different types of sedimentary rocks. Observe the rocks in the \u201cSentosa Rocks!\u201d display. Describe the colour, grain size and any other visual characteristics of each of the four types of sedimentary rocks. The notes provided above should provide you with some assistance. You will need this information for Task 2. Task 2: Search for the core samples (cylindrical \u201ctubes\u201d of stones) located near the entrance of the gallery. Observe the core samples of the two formations: Fort Siloso and Tanjong Rimau and try to identify the sedimentary rocks that make up the formation using the rock samples you have observed and learnt about in Task 1. Justify your answer with the similarities observed in terms of colour, texture and grain size. Task 3: Learning about the Origins of the Rock Formations Having identified and learnt more about the composition of the rock formations in Task 2, using your new found information coupled with description notes above on the environment of rock formation, deduce what processes may have produced the sediments that made up the rocks in the two formations. Is it fluvial (from a river) or deltaic\/marine (from the sea)?  Explain your thought process.  Once you have your answers, either use the Geocaching Message Centre or email to send the answers. Don\u2019t worry about getting all the answers right, but do make a reasonable attempt at the questions as well as a produce proof that you were on-site to make the observations. You may log once you submit your answers and we will be in touch if there are any issues.

Come see for yourself, beyond the glamour and the lights, what this tiny nation of Singapore is built upon.   The infinity pool on top of the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) Hotel offers an unparalleled view of Singapore City. To get up to the roof, you will need to be a hotel guest to access the infinity pool, or visit one of the posh bars for a drink. Alternatively, take the lift up TOWER ONE to the 57th floor. There is a small smoking area and viewing platform outside the restaurant which you can visit for free. Looking around, you will see Singapore\u2019s shimmering skyscrapers, glitzy lights and hotels, and the Singapore river. On the seaward side lies the open sea, countless ships, and the magnificent Gardens by the Bay. And amongst all these, you will also see ever-constant signs of construction, for Singapore is constantly evolving.  Marina Bay Begin by looking out on the seaward side. On your left stretches the beaches of East Coast Park, and before you the Supertree Grove and the Conservatories of the Gardens by the Bay. 50 years ago, the very land that you stand on did not exist, and all that you see before you had been reclaimed from the sea. Even now, at just 719 sq km (278 sq mi), the entire country of Singapore is tinier than Tonga or New York City. Singapore, in a sense, was literally built out of nothing at all.  View in 1977 of the whole Marina area freshly reclaimed from the sea. (Source: URA) Ships on the sea  Looking out towards the sea, you will see ships of all sizes and shapes \u2013 oil tankers, container ships, ships with cranes, ships with cars, military ships, cruise ships, tugs and barges \u2013 of all manners and sorts stretching as far as the eye can see. Founded on sea trade, Singapore is a critical mid-way point between Asia and Europe, and sees an average of 130,000 ships annually (350 a day!) which dock or harbour in its calm waters. Currently it is the world's busiest transshipment port where a fifth of the world's shipping containers, and half of the world's annual supply of crude oil comes through. The sea and its passing ships are the lifeblood of Singapore. Pasir Panjang Container Terminal  Look to your right and (as of 2018) you will see a vast plot of empty land with giraffe-like giant cranes, and beyond, the island of Sentosa. This port was once the busiest in the world, and those giant cranes used to lift containers off immense ships onto the backs of trucks queueing up below. Currently, the Pasir Panjang operations are being moved to the Tuas Megaport in the western end of Singapore, ending an era of port operations that started in 1819. This relocation will free up valuable waterfront land to be redeveloped for a new city area. These are some examples of how Singapore keeps reinventing itself through constant change.  We hope that this cache helps you appreciate how Singapore \u2013 a tiny island \u2013 was built from the sea with sheer human endeavour to become the improbable nation that you see today.   Requirements  To log this cache, you will need to visit the MBS rooftop and look out for something under construction - some hoardings or cranes or trucks building or tearing down some thing or other. Browsing the previous logs might help. Take and post a picture of the construction, giving a decription of what you see and what you think it is. Adding your feelings or thoughts being on the rooftop is most welcome. Posts which do not adequately show that you had indeed visited the rooftop will be deleted.

Airport Diagram of Kallang Airport (Image: Wonders of World Aviation) As cities like ours develop, the ever-increasing demand for international air passenger volume and for the capability to accommodate larger and heavier aircraft inevitably strains older, smaller and poorer-equipped airports. When Kallang Airport was decommissioned, the Singapore International Airport was moved to Paya Lebar, and later to the bigger and better Changi, with the conversion of the Paya Lebar airfield to its present use as an air force base. This phenomenon is, of course, not unique to Singapore.

Look at it through a reflection or a lens, and you will be petrified. First introduced in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the power of this creature is one to be feared.  Rumour has it that it has been around the Magic Forest, lurking in the darkness and petrifying unsuspecting creatures.  This cache brings you back into the Forest, where you can see relics of this creature\u2019s power!  The Earthcache  The Basilisk\u2019s powers may be unimaginably scary, but did you know that Mother Nature herself, too, has the awesome powers of turning living creatures into stone! At the published coordinates, you will find specimens which show how trees can be transformed into stones, as we explore the phenomenon of \u201cpetrified wood\u201d  What is petrified wood?    \u201cPetrified\u201d is derived from the Greek word \u201cPetros\u201d meaning \u201cstone\u201d and petrified wood is basically fossilised wood: wood that has literally turned completely into stone. Do not be fooled by the stones\u2019 looks: petrified wood look like trees, are shaped like trees but are 100% NOT wood.  How are they formed?  Many, many years ago, these stones were really what you might expect them to be: perfectly good living trees. But, some catastrophic event, like a volcanic eruption or a flood caused the trees to be buried in ashes or mud extremely quickly. Such a swift process means that the wood had no time to be broken down by bacteria or fungi on the surface, and thus, becomes preserved and locked in the form it had when it was buried. This is further bolstered by the oxygen-poor conditions of the ground itself, meaning that most bacteria and organisms that consume organic matter cannot thrive, slowing down its decomposition dramatically.  Over time, mineral-rich water in the soil seeps into the organic cells of the wood filling up the gaps in between. When the water evaporates, the minerals themselves get left behind and these minerals slowly replaces the content of the cells with harder substances and crystals like quartz or calcite. The minerals imitate their moulds so completely that they look just like the wood itself. Over the centuries, all the organic matter is slowly broken down, but the more resilient stuff, which is the minerals that have seeped and solidified in the cells, remain behind. The result is stone that looks exactly like the wood that it was formed in, just like how the jelly looks exactly like the mould it was left to cool in.  What do they look like?     The minerals that from the petrified wood are usually quartz and calcite which are normally colourless, but the actually wood themselves take on colours based on the elemental and mineral content of the surrounding earth.  The following lists the common minerals and colours that they provide the petrified wood:  \u2022         carbon \u2013 black \u2022         cobalt \u2013 green\/blue \u2022         chromium \u2013 green\/blue \u2022         copper \u2013 green\/blue \u2022         iron oxides \u2013 red, brown, and yellow \u2022         manganese \u2013 pink\/orange \u2022         manganese oxides \u2013 blackish\/yellow  Petrified wood is found all over the world where the conditions are right for the transformation from wood to stone. There have been no specimens of such stones found in Singapore to date, so the Earthcache site provides locals an opportunity to observe some of these stones up close. Petrified wood tell the story how the plants and climate of ages past, and these stones, too, tell a story of the ecology and climate of our region. Where did these petrified wood come from? As mentioned, Singapore lacks deposits of petrified wood, but one of our neighbouring countries have these beautiful stones in abundance. The wood you see at the site come from the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and date to the Neogene geological Period (3 - 23 million years ago), found buried most often in a layer of tuff (which provides a huge clue on how they came to be buried). The climate of the islands during this period was very much like today: hot and humid tropical climate with plenty of rainfall. This was ideal for the growth of huge tracts of dense rain forests on the islands. The abundance of trees, coupled with certain conditions and natural phenomena were ideal for the creation of these petrified wood during the Neogene period. To date, thousands of tonnes of deposits of these wood have been uncovered in Indonesia. The petrified wood you see at the site were created from the dominant family of hardwood trees in Southeast Asia, the Dipterocarpaceae. These family of trees still exist in our rain forest today, and so these wood were moulds of the ancestors of the flora that we can still see today. These show that climate in the region was not very different from that millions of years ago, and that the rain forests of the region already existed. It's truly beautiful how these stones can give us a biological window into the past  The Earthcache site     At the coordinates, you will find a set of petrified wood \u201ctrees\u201d related to the tasks for this Earthcache. You will need to complete the following tasks to complete the Earthcache    Describe the shape, colour and texture of the petrified wood at the coordinates. What are the different colours that are present on the wood? Where are these colours on the surface of the wood? Describe the features of the original trees that can still be seen on the petrified wood today  Suggest the identities of the minerals present in the location where the wood were buried based on the colour of the wood.  Based on the area of origin of the petrified wood at the coordinates (i.e. Indonesia), suggest how the wood that was to become petrified were quickly buried. In addition, why were the conditions in the Indonesian forests so ideal for the petrification of these wood?    You can log the cache once you send us the e-mail with the answers. There is no need to wait for a reply. We will let you know if there are any issues.  Feel free to post your pictures of your visit to the Magic Forest in your logs, but, PLEASE, no photos that will give away the answers to the tasks.","hint":"task three: look at the petrification process and compare the conditions with the climate in indonesia (or that which you are experiencing right now in singapore). also, what is the ring of fire?","total_found":"832","total_did_not_find":"9"},{"id":6723327,"code":"GC7PEZE","name":"ALC - Potato or Tomato?","geocacheType":2,"containerType":8,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":3,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.279267,"longitude":103.860633,"ownerId":"PRTAG19","ownerName":"cakesandcurls","placedDate":"2018-06-06","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-13","lastFoundTime":"17:23:08","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC7PEZE","description":" \r A hefty seven tons, this impressive bronze sculpture is 9m long and 3m tall.

Canopy \u2013 Shaped like an inverted umbrella, the canopy was assembled and hoisted via a hydraulic jack system (except the 50-metre Supertree canopy which was assembled at its final height).     ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE FUNCTIONS   11 Supertrees have canopies embedded with environmentally sustainable functions.   Some will have photovoltaic cells to harvest solar energy for lighting up the Supertrees. Others are integrated with the Cooled Conservatories and serve as air exhaust receptacles.     PLANTS   Over 158,000 plants comprising more than 700 species and varieties of bromeliads, orchids, ferns and tropical flowering climbers have been planted on the 18 Supertrees.   Examples of some of the species include the Tillandsia stricta from Brazil, Tillandsia fasciculate from Panama, Cattleya maxima from Ecuador, and Pseudorhipsalis from Costa Rica.   The Supertrees have different planting schemes in various colours ranging from warm tones like reds, browns, orange and yellows, to cooler hues like silver and pink.   The plants were chosen based on the following considerations:   - Suitability for vertical planting\r - Lightweight and hardy\r - Soil-less\r - Ease of maintanence\r - Suitability for Singapore\u2019s climate\r - Not commonly found in Singapore\r - High visual interest   To log in this virtual, you will have to go to the Gardens by the Bay and take a picture of yourself with the supertrees behind you, to attach to your log.

When ripe, the succulent yellow flesh is enjoyed by people as well as animals. The Mangifera indica is not native to Singapore. It is believed to have originated from India although this is uncertain. It has been in cultivation for hundreds of years. It can grow up to 30 m tall, with a dense rounded crown of dark green leathery leaves, and rough, shallowly fissured bark. The leaves, when crushed, smell of turpentine (witness this yourself!) The flowers are fragrant, held in dense bunches and are greenish-yellow to pale cream or even reddish in colour. There are usually two flowering seasons each year. The fruit contains a single large and hard seed that is round to oblong in shape, up to 20 cm long and 10 cm wide. The fruit ripens from green to yellow or orange.

If you think Singapore is hot, this garden will feel like you\u2019re in one of the many dry deserts in the world. If you ignore the humidity, I am sure the ambient heat will make you feel just right at home with these plants.   As you amble through the garden, you\u2019ll be surrounded by succulents and cacti galore, and you can learn about some of the more charismatic species featured in the garden from the information boards. Just try not to prick yourself on the many thorny flora that you\u2019ll find here in the garden.  And\u2026 since you\u2019re reading this \u2013 here\u2019s a pop quiz: do you know the difference between cacti and succulents?  Succulents are a broad group of plants that can be found in every continent except Antarctica and are defined by their ability to store water in their leaves and stems, which makes them especially resilient to long periods of drought. The term is not a taxonomic one i.e. it doesn\u2019t define a specific family or order of plants, but rather adaptation features of certain plants. The succulents technically include almost all cacti, the aloes, baobabs, yuccas, palm trees and even some unexpected ones, like orchids and figs.   Cacti (the plural of cactus) are plants from the family Cactaceae, which are only native to the Americas. Yup, there are no (native) cacti in the Sahara! The cacti all share one very distinct feature, which are their thorns. The thorns are modified leaves and branches, designed to minimise surface area from which water may be lost from and to deter animals from grazing on them. The water is stored in the rather substantial stem of the cactus, which is the succulent part of the cactus. There are three distinct types of cacti: the bulbous (round, squat cacti), columnar (tall and slender) and arborescent (tree-like). You\u2019ll see a good variety of cacti in the garden and, better still, you\u2019re now armed with this new-found knowledge.   And about the cache: please do not step off the trail or damage any plants while searching for it! You\u2019ll be able to retrieve the cache with no harm to both you and the plants\u2019 lives and limbs. The cache is well-camouflaged, but I am sure it\u2019ll not escape your eagle eyes (and there\u2019s the additional hint to assist as well).

Satay by the Bay is a hawker centre located between iconic Gardens by the Bay (South) and the Marina Barrage at the edge of the Marina Reservoir. It follows the Singaporean concept of the Hawker Centre, with food stalls selling a variety of local delicacies and a shared seating space. Locals, of course, are no stranger to this sort of locale, but it does prove to be quite an experience of the tourists.   What makes this hawker centre somewhat distinct from its cousins is that it claims descent from the legendary Satay Club at the Esplanade. Satay, for those who are unfamiliar with it, is a Malay dish comprising of skewered meat (often chicken, mutton, or beef) with a peanut sauce dip and a side of glutinous rice, raw cucumbers and onions. It is typically prepared over a charcoal grill, and the sight and smell of the seller fanning the flames of his grill in the open is usually a sure sign that there is satay to be had.  Singapore\u2019s original go-to place for Satay in the 1970s \u2013 1990s was the Satay Club on the Esplanade in front of the Padang. Satay hawkers would set up shop on Queen Elizabeth Walk and patrons would throng the stalls to enjoy their sticks of meat from their favourite stall while enjoying the sea breeze and the company under the five big rain trees that still stand at the park today. There were up to 28 stalls at the Satay Club before it was closed to make way for the Esplanade Theatres. Efforts to relocate the Satay Club to other places like Clarke Quay were short-lived due to higher rental costs and lower patronage.      The Satay by the Bay project, which was developed in tandem with the Gardens, claims to be the latest reincarnation of the Satay Club.

In 1956, a group of prominent female educationalists in Singapore established the Singapore Girls' Vocational High School, a Chinese medium vocational school originally located in Oxley Road, to educate and prepare girls for the workforce. The aim of the of the school was to provide opportunities for female teenagers to study mainstream subjects and attend vocational training courses such as Book keeping, Home Economics and English and Chinese Typewriting. In 1972, there was a change of members in the School Advisory Committee. With the donation from the board of directors, the Lee Foundation, and a grant given by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the school was re-sited to Toa Payoh East and renamed Pei Dao Secondary School. In 1978, in keeping with MOE\u2019s policy of the integration of students from different language streams, Pei Dao Secondary School began to take in English stream pupils and became co-educational. In 1986, the school relinquished its added school status and became a government school. In 2001, Pei Dao Secondary School was renamed Punggol Secondary School and relocated to Punggol New Town. A quick search online will show you PSS's heritage, but one you can appreciate from this location is the fact that when the school was moved from its former Toa Payoh location 2001, every piece of land surrounding the school grounds was open fields. There was a only one bus service that ran through the town. In fact, the school moved to Punggol even before the Punggol MRT station was opened to the public (in 2003). While you stand here, take a good look at your surroundings and imagine what this area was like at the turn of the century. Observe the school, the sounds of generation after generation of students passing through the gates of the school. It was recently repainted and the colours of the school logo made more prominent on its walls. You'll see the glaring yellow facing the street, symbolising the bright future that is attainable when students strive for academic excellence, self-discipline and sound values in life.   ~~!!Congrats lemaklemak on the FTF!!~~","hint":"reach around the back. grey.","total_found":"46","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8878418,"code":"GCA1TGG","name":"Straitsview","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.0,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.420267,"longitude":103.90435,"ownerId":"PR18R3JT","ownerName":"laurenspang","placedDate":"2022-11-05","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-19","lastFoundTime":"20:08:46","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GCA1TGG","description":"Northshore Straitsview is one of the estates in Punggol with a true sea view.

At the published coordinates, you will find a large sample of serpentinite, which will be the subject of our study for this EC. However, before we embark on your learning journey, we will first need to learn about the formation of metamorphic rocks.  Part 1: What is Metamorphism?    Overview Metamorphic rocks are one of the three main groups of rocks, the others being igneous and sedimentary, and they are created from the other two through a process known as metamorphism. During this process, rocks and minerals are transformed due to changes in temperature, pressure, and\/or chemical environment. This process occurs deep within the Earth's crust, where rocks are subjected to intense heat and pressure or exposed to fluids that alter their composition. During metamorphism, the mineral composition, texture, and physical properties of rocks can change significantly. For example, a sedimentary rock may be transformed into a metamorphic rock through the process of recrystallization, where the original mineral grains are replaced by new ones that are larger and more tightly packed. This can lead to the formation of new minerals, such as mica, garnet, or quartz. Metamorphism can also cause rocks to become more dense, harder, and more resistant to erosion, making them more suitable for building and construction purposes. Some of the most common examples of metamorphic rocks include marble (shown below), slate, and gneiss, which are formed from limestone, shale, and granite, respectively.   Let us now examine two ways metamorphism can occur: contact and regional metamorphism. Contact Metamorphism Contact metamorphism is a type of metamorphism that occurs when rocks are altered by contact with a heat source, such as an intrusion of magma. When magma moves into a rock formation, it heats up the surrounding rocks, causing them to undergo chemical and physical changes.  The intensity of contact metamorphism depends on several factors, including the temperature and duration of the heat exposure, the composition of the original rocks, and the type and size of the intruding magma body. In general, the closer the rocks are to the magma source, the greater the degree of metamorphism. During contact metamorphism, the heat causes the minerals in the original rocks to recrystallize or form new minerals. For example, limestone can be transformed into marble, a harder and more dense rock, by the introduction of heat from a nearby magma body. Shale can be transformed into hornfels, a fine-grained metamorphic rock, under similar conditions. One of the most distinctive features of contact metamorphism is the presence of a \"contact zone\" around the magma intrusion, known as an areole, where the original rocks have been altered by the heat. This zone can range in size from a few centimeters to several kilometers, depending on the size of the magma body and the surrounding rocks. Regional Metamorphism Regional metamorphism is a type of metamorphism that occurs over large areas, typically at convergent plate boundaries or in mountain-building processes. It is caused by the combination of heat, pressure, and chemical activity over a long period of time, often millions of years. In regional metamorphism, rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures, usually from tectonic forces, as they are buried deep within the Earth's crust. This process can cause the minerals in the rocks to change, creating new minerals and altering the texture and composition of the original rock.  One of the most common types of rock to undergo regional metamorphism is shale, which can be transformed into slate, phyllite, schist, or gneiss depending on the degree of metamorphism. The metamorphic grade of a rock is determined by the temperature and pressure conditions it has experienced, with higher grades indicating more intense metamorphism. Part 2: Classifying Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are classified into broad groups called \u201cfacies\u201d. Rock belonging to the same metamorphic facies undergo similar metamorphic changes due to similar temperature and pressure conditions. Think of it like different neighborhoods in a city, each with a different character and vibe. In this case, each neighborhood represents different metamorphic facies, with its own unique set of rocks and minerals. Metamorphic facies are classified based on the mineral assemblages that are formed under specific pressure and temperature conditions. These assemblages are determined by the original mineralogy of the rock, and the degree and duration of heat and pressure that the rock has been exposed to. A diagram of the different facies is shown below: As you can see, there are several different metamorphic facies, ranging from low-grade to high-grade, depending on the intensity of metamorphism. For example, the zeolite facies represents the lowest grade of metamorphism, characterized by the formation of minerals such as zeolites, while the granulite facies represents the highest grade, characterized by the formation of minerals such as garnet and sillimanite. And\u2026 finally, let\u2019s learn about the rock you\u2019ll see at the GZ: serpentinite. Part 3: On Serpentinite Serpentinite is a type of metamorphic rock that is composed mainly of the mineral serpentine, which is formed through serpentinization by the alteration of minerals such as olivine or pyroxene in rocks, such as peridotite, in the presence of water and\/or carbon dioxide. It is typically green in color and has a characteristic waxy or greasy appearance.  Serpentinite is commonly found in areas of the Earth's crust where there has been a significant amount of tectonic activity, such as subduction zones or fault zones. It is formed when water infiltrates cracks and crevices in rocks that are being subjected to high pressure and low temperature conditions, causing them to break down and transform into serpentinite. Its beautiful green hue and patterns make serpentinite sought after as cladding material and for sculptures, such as the one you see here. Metamorphic rocks are a rare sight in Singapore, where most of the island is either underlain by granite or sedimentary deposits, so this rare \u201cgem\u201d provided a useful lesson. And so... on to your tasks! Part 4: Earthcache Tasks At the published coordinates, you will find a water feature and sculpture that is a gift to Singapore from the city of Vienna, Austria. This sculpture is made entirely from serpentinite, and exhibits many of the features of the rock that has been described in Part 3.  The rock that is used for this sculpture is known as Tauerngr\u00fcn from the foot of the Gro\u00dfvenediger, a mountain in the Austrian Alps. The serpentinite from this area exhibits veins due to dissolved minerals percipitating into cracks in the serpentinite during its formation. The veins in Tauerngr\u00fcn are usually deposits of talc and calcite.      Based on the information provided and your observations on site, answer the following questions:  Describe the colour and surface patterns of the serpentinite you see at the published coordinates.  What is the range of the width of the veins in the serpentinite used for the water feature? Describe their shape, colour and pattern. Is it consistent with the colour and texture of talc and\/or calcite (which are usually white\/light coloured)? Is serpentinite formed through contact or regional metamorphism? Explain your answer based on your observations and the information provided in the listing, Serpentinite is a rock classified under the greenschist facies. Under what range of temperature and pressure conditions does it form?   Take a photo of yourself or a personal object with the sign containing the name of the sculpture and the sculptor, and attach it to  your log.   As with all Earthcaches, please send your responses to me via email or the Message Centre. There is no need to get all the answers perfectly right as long as a conscious and honest effort is made.  Logs that do not meet the task requirements may be deleted. I hope you enjoyed your geology field trip here, and happy caching!

The gleams of sunlight hurt your eyes somewhat, but they soon adjust to reveal a path through a field of reeds leading to a body of water.  But\u2026 you can\u2019t remember how you got here: What were you doing? Where did you come from? Why are you here? Your recent memories are a complete fog \u2013 \u201cmaybe I am in a dream of some sort?\u201d you think to yourself. Pinching yourself doesn\u2019t seem to work. Since you are here, you might as well continue forward, and there\u2019s only one path leading ahead. Hopefully, you\u2019ll find some answers to why you are here soon.  Walk towards Waypoint 2   Waypoint 2: The Green Stone (N01 16.905 E103 52.189) You tread through the fields warily, not knowing what strange things you may encounter in this foreign land. A breeze gently blows from the sea, and the reeds sways mesmerizingly in the wind, as if beckoning you forward. It is not long before you reach the water\u2019s edge, where you spot a prominent green stone with water spouting out of its top.  \u201cThat\u2019s nice\u201d, you wonder, \u201cI could some fresh water to cool myself down right about now\u201d. The heat and humidity here is something you\u2019d probably have to get used to, as the first bead of sweat forms on your forehead.  Near the stone, you find a sign, telling you about the {A} water jets that spout from the stone. Must be some sort of spring, it seems, and you approach the stone for a closer look and perhaps, a drink. As you get within a few paces of the green stone edifice, some words etched on the stone begin to glow: Dear Traveler, Questions, you certainly have about your presence here; Answers, you will eventually find; Guidance, you will find at the Boabab Grove; Three Trials, you will first face: Dragons, Giants and Creatures await you. \u201cThat\u2019s some bad poetry\u201d, you mutter, \u201ceven ChatGPT can do better.\u201d However, it is fair warning, and if you are ever going to get out of here, you must take whatever this weird place is going to throw at you. Now, what is it that it said about \u201cdragons\u201d? If you are going to try to confront the \u201cDragons\u201d head on, go to Waypoint 20  If you are going to try to sneak past the \u201cDragons\u201d quietly, go to Waypoint 13  Waypoint 3: A Fun(gi) Filled World (N01 16.863 E103 51.890) You follow the light source, which turns out to be more than one object. In fact, they were a whole score of giant mushrooms in a huge cave. With some trepidation, you enter the cave to be greeted by the most beautiful sight you have ever seen \u2013 dozens of mushrooms, clinging on the walls and growing from the ground, light up the chamber with a faint glow.  You walk around slowly in awe as you inspect the {E} exits of the cave. Truly a bizarre sight, and one that you have only read about, but have yet to see in person. You spend some time taking in the spectacle, but unfortunately you must move on.  You inspect the exits of the cave, and one seem to smell of\u2026 fruit? You couldn\u2019t quite tell which one, but it\u2019s definitely\u2026 fruity.  To follow the fruity aroma, go to Waypoint 7  To choose another exit, go to Waypoint 6   Waypoint 4: Tempus Fugit (N01 16.999 E103 51.897) You follow the sweet smell, though something tells you that it could be a trap of some sort. However, its allure is too strong, and you find yourself being strung along without thinking too much about it. The smell leads you to a flower garden, but with one addition that makes it unlike any you have been to before. A giant clock sits in its centre, surrounded by screws with {D} sides, keeping time faithfully despite the absence of any human to maintain it. Confused, you stand before it, somewhat hypnotized by the smooth movement of the hands around the flower beds.  \u201cWhere is the third trial?\u201d, you wonder. Looking around, you notice a sign board with some words on it. There is a riddle on it\u2026 and instantly, you realise that this is an intellectual trial, rather than a physical one. The riddle reads: \u201cLike a bird, time is fleeting, and it flies free. Fly towards freedom, and freedom you shall find\u201d.  \u201cStrange riddle, and the poetry still hasn\u2019t improved,\u201d you complain to yourself, but there is a puzzle to be solved. You search for a hint, and at the base of the sign, you find a wooden bird with a number etched on it\u2026 that\u2019s it! You head in the direction of the clock with that number, confident that you have finally made it through the trials.   Proceed to Waypoint 23  Waypoint 5: The Stone Forest (N01 17.040 E103 51.919) You follow the path you are on towards what you can only assume is the last trial you must face. It has truly been a strange and dangerous journey so far, but you know yet more dangers lay ahead. As you traverse the path, you notice something odd about the trees\u2026 they seem to be made of polished stone. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d you think, as you stop to inspect one of the tall trunks. They certainly look like tree trunks, but the colour and the texture is all wrong.  The forest is eerily quiet\u2026 something is indeed amiss. You listen closely\u2026 is that a slithering sound you hear? You quickly hide behind one of the stone trunks, where you spot a sign that warns you of the culprit\u2026 a mythical creature with {D} letters in its name. You have heard the stories of this monster from back you were a child, and you know not to look into its eyes.  You see its shadow from between the trees\u2026 you need to think quick. You spot the distinctive trunk of a baobab tree in the distance, and instantly recall the words on the green stone at the start. You close your eyes and make a dash for the tree. You run straight into the trunk, smacking your face on it\u2026 but the pain you feel is nothing compared to being eternally petrified.    Proceed to Waypoint 23  Waypoint 6: The Menagerie (N01 16.823 E103 51.815) You follow the path, down to where the chatter of animals grows louder. You are shocked to see a whole host of animals around a central campfire having what seems to be a lively conversation with one another. Their words are unintelligible to you, but they seem to have no trouble understanding each other.  You stand there dumbfounded, wondering what to make of the scene \u2013 this is nothing that you have ever come to expect, and this on a day in which you have already seen all sorts of wonders unimaginable to Man. As you stood there, a rhinoceros beetle, about {F}.5 centimetres long, comes up to you to invite you to sit down with them by the campfire. Initially, you think this is some sort of trap, but they seem friendly enough, so you join them. You have no idea what was going on, but somehow, you feel like you belong \u2013 after all, aren\u2019t humans also part of the Web of Life?  After an hour, one of the animals steps out of the circle, and signals you to follow it. You agree and stand up, wondering where it\u2019ll be taking you\u2026   Follow it to Waypoint 18  Waypoint 7: The Mountain of Fruit and Flowers (N01 16.842 E103 51.864) You proceed down the path, the smell of fruit growing ever stronger as you approach. You enter an open courtyard with {F} exits, surrounded by fruit trees of every type. The courtyard seems empty, but you have a feeling that you are being watched.  Suddenly, a macaque jumps in front you, startling you. Another macaque lands right behind you, and another appears, and yet another\u2026 soon, you are surrounded by an entire troop of monkeys. You feel trapped, but before long, the swarm parts like the Red Sea, and a monkey, clearly their leader, approaches you. It shouts something unintelligible, and one of its \u201cfollowers\u201d hops out of the swarm and retrieves a wrapped banana leaf filled with fruits of every colour and shape, some of which you have never seen before. It offers them to you, and you try a bite of a few \u2013 each as tangy and sweet as the next.  You have your fill, and once you signal that you have had enough, the leader of the monkeys beckons you to follow it\u2026 where is he taking you?   Follow it to Waypoint 18  Waypoint 8: The Malay Garden (N01 16.943 E103 51.791)   You enter what looks like a Malay village, filled with little market gardens, fruit orchard and traditional wooden houses. You wander around the gardens, looking at the different fruits and vegetables that have been planted, resisting the temptation to pluck any of them.  Finally, you spot an old lady in what of the corners of the garden weaving a mat from mengkuang leaves next to a basket of fruit. She greets you, \u201cApa khabar? Welcome to my dusun! I have been expecting your visit.\u201d She gives you a toothy smile and you smile back. She continues, \u201cBefore I take you to your journey\u2019s end, let us enjoy this beautiful moment in Nature.\u201d The light of the pelita illuminates the array of fruits and vegetables around here.  She goes on, \u201cWe, the Malay folk, have literary traditions inspired by the fruits and vegetables that we plant. Take, for instance, the pantun, a simple four-line poem passed down from generation to generation to impart morals to our young ones. Here are {F} of my favourites\u201d You spend some time listening to her poems and stories, and after a while, she gets up. \u201cCome, my child, your journey is about to end\u201d she says, as she extends her hand and leads you out of the garden.   Follow her to Waypoint 18  Waypoint 9: A World of Palms (N01 16.911 E103 51.899) You walk down the path, and as you continue in the moonlight, you realise something interesting about the trees around you: they are all palm trees! \u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d, you mutter, \u201c\u2026surely this cannot be some sort of coincidence\u201d.  As you look around, you find yourself craving for a coconut. It\u2019s been a while since you last ate or drank, and you could really use some nourishment right now. In the darkness, it is a little tough to identify the structure of the palm trees, of which there are {E} shapes. However, you managed to spot the distinct trunk of a coconut tree, and lucky for you, there was a green coconut not too far from the base of the tree. You tried your utmost best to get the coconut open, which easier said than done without a knife, but you manage to get a small hole open, and quickly slurp up the juice within.  Satiated, you decide to push onwards, sensing that the journey\u2019s end is approaching. As you trek through the palms, somewhere ahead, you hear some animals in the bush\u2026 If you choose to try to find the animals, go towards Waypoint 6  If you choose to avoid them, go towards Waypoint 7.  Waypoint 10: The Colonial Garden (N01 16.890 E103 51.769) You enter a classic English garden, complete with flowering trees and trellises. The circular garden looks perfect for a spot of afternoon tea even at this hour. You have a look around, spotting various crates of commodities ready for export. Hmm\u2026 it seems like you are in the garden of some sort of rich merchant or plantation owner. As you walk past the crates, you hear a voice: \u201cHello there, traveler! I see you have taken an interest in my fine goods!\u201d. You turn around surprised, looking for the source of the voice. You see a well-dressed gentleman smoking a pipe, sitting at a garden table with two cups of fine china and a teapot waving at you. He adds, \u201cCare to join me for a cuppa?\u201d You take a seat at the table. He pipes up, \u201cI have been expecting you, even at this late hour. Unfortunately, you missed tea, and I do make a fine brew. At this hour, coffee is a lot more apt, and you are in luck!\u201d He pours a cup of a strong black brew and the aroma of the coffee strikes and energizes you. He goes on: \u201cCan you believe that the government thinks that this fine bean will yield a revenue of $2,{F}88.320? Anyway, drink up, I believe you and I have some important business to attend to.\u201d You dutifully finish your cup of coffee and upon putting your cup down, the gentleman gets up and says, \u201cTally ho! We have an adventure to finish!\u201d   Follow him to Waypoint 18  Waypoint 11: The Desert (N01 16.989 E103 51.991) You choose to enter the Desert, hoping that no creature that could pose any danger could be hiding in such an unforgiving place. Initially, you were quite happy with your decision, as that proved to be right. Not a single creature stirred among the cacti and succulents that dot the landscape, certainly nothing that could be considered \u201cgiant\u201d.  However, as the sun bears down, you start reconsidering your decision\u2026 at least there was water by the river\u2026 but here? As you lick your parched lips, you hope that you are heading in the right direction as the landscape looks the same in every direction. If only there was some sort of landmark that could guide you through this hellscape.  As you reach the top of a dune, you notice a tall object in the distance\u2026 could it be some sort of beacon? Glad that there was some object you could walk towards rather than wandering aimlessly, you make a beeline towards it. And, as you get closer, you realise that it is not a beacon\u2026 but just another cactus - a very tall cactus, taller than any cactus you have ever seen in your life, and you estimate that it\u2019s {C}8 metres tall. Almost giving up hope, you stare at the natural behemoth for a while, and you notice an arrow nailed onto the cactus. Well\u2026 you suppose that this must be the route forward then, and with no other choice, you head in the direction it points in. Eventually, you reach the edge of the desert. You rejoice as the current ordeal is over, but you need to pick your next destination. You see two mounds tower in the distance\u2026 could this be another beacon? If you choose to head towards to mounds, head to Waypoint 19  If you choose to ignore it, and follow the path you are on, head to Waypoint 15   Waypoint 12: The Great River (N01 16.969 E103 51.985) You choose to follow your instincts, heading down to river, where you figured it\u2019ll be safer since there is a clear route to follow. There\u2019s also a source of fresh water, too, in case you get hopelessly lost, though you doubt you\u2019d be able to cross the river safely.  Luckily, the path winds along the riverbank, rather than ending by the river. As you follow the meandering path, you recall once again that there was not just one trial you had to face, but three. That thought startles you, as it meant that danger probably lurks around the corner once again.  Soon, the path dips down close to river, and your sense of danger and trepidation rises\u2026 \u201care there crocodiles or hippos waiting for me down there?\u201d you think, knowing that whatever lay beyond could be worse. But the coast seems clear, so you continue, hoping that it\u2019s all just the adrenaline messing with you. Suddenly, the waters roil, and you steel yourself, for a large fish, {C}.8 metres in length, with a red tail and whiskers like a cat, leaps out of the muddy water, right at you. Instinctively, you duck, and it jumps right over you. Wet from the river water displaced by the giant fish, you run for your life, not looking back until you reach the safety of the trees.    You calm down, feeling like this latest danger has certainly passed. There\u2019s no turning back now, and so trudge towards the jungle\u2019s edge. Here, you spot two large earthen mounds in the distance\u2026 If you choose to head towards the mounds, head to Waypoint 19  If you choose to ignore it, and follow the path you are on, head to Waypoint 5   Waypoint 13: The Canyon (N01 17.001 E103 51.990) \u201cAlways better to be careful\u201d, you think\u2026 the last thing you want is to meet an untimely death here. You continue the path ahead, carefully sticking close to the shrubs and looking out for any flying creatures that may swoop down.  Your journey brings you to a Canyon, filled with strange rock formations. \u201cYeah, looks exactly like one of those places you\u2019d find a dragon,\u201d you think, and your thoughts were immediately confirmed. A silhouette of a dragon perched upon a high rock pillar looms ahead, but fortunately, it is not looking down at where you are. Imagine if you were running right at it - the echoes of your footsteps in the canyon would surely have alerted it to you.   You spot a sign close by, and carefully approach it, where you read about the dragon\u2019s {B}-word name. An interesting name indeed, but despite how innocuous it sounds, you decide that it is one best not to be trifled with. Fortunately, the exit of the canyon is nearby, and the dragon still hasn\u2019t noticed you.  While you have certainly dodged a bullet here, surely there are more dangers to come\u2026 and, as if on cue, not too far from the canyon, another choice presents itself. Before you lay two more paths: one descends into a large river valley and the other crosses a sandy desert\u2026  To go to the River Valley, proceed to Waypoint 12  To go into the Desert, proceed to Waypoint 11   Waypoint 14: The Way of Nature (N01 16.986 E103 51.903) You pick the left path, and you head down into what seems to be another forest. However, that sense of dread that you felt in the first part of the adventure is no longer there. The forest is serene and calm, even in the dying light. As you continue, the canopy above begins to close in over you, and foliage surrounds you.  You see a source of light in the darkness before you, an eerie blue and green that seems like it comes from another world. You ponder whether you should make a detour towards the light or continue on the current path.  If you choose to investigate the source of the light, proceed to Waypoint 3   If you choose to ignore it and continue the path, proceed to Waypoint 9  Waypoint 15: The Return of the King (N01 17.058 E103 51.932) You continue on your way, hoping that this ordeal will come to an end soon. A large pedestal, reminiscent of an opening scene from a Disney movie, looms ahead. Counting the trials you have faced thus far, you realise that you have only faced two, and yet one more remains. Perhaps, the pedestal has something to do with it.  As you approach the pedestal, you notice a fearsome creature lurking just behind the pedestal. You prepare to run, but it is swifter, and with a loud roar, it leaps onto the pedestal and looks directly at you.  You drop to your knees, and it lets out of hearty laugh. \u201cThat is indeed the respect that I ask for, for I am the Monarch of ______, China\u201d (where {D} is the number of letters in the placename). Still petrified, you barely utter, \u201cTh-th-thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty\u201d. The creature looks down at you and beckons you to rise. Reluctantly, you stand, and it points towards a grove of trees in the distance and says, \u201cTraveler, I know what you seek. You have done well to stay in my presence. Lesser mortals have fled before me. Go forth and continue your quest. I shall not be of further impedance.\u201d You bow to the creature and with a nod of gratitude, you make your exit and head towards the grove.   Proceed to Waypoint 23  Waypoint 16: The Chinese Garden (N01 16.975 E103 51.816) You enter the Chinese Garden and find yourself surrounding by Bonsais and Bamboos planted among limestone rocks of all shapes and sizes. It really does feel like you have entered a Chinese watercolour and ink painting, and as you wander the grounds, you find a man at a desk with his scrolls. You approach him and he looks up. Without looking at you, he says: \u201cAh, I have been expecting you, Traveler. Welcome to my Garden, who is my Muse - my perpetual source of inspiration. Look how the light from the lanterns shines through the bamboo leaves, creating dancing shadows on the ground. See how the bonsai twists and grows in gnarled shapes \u2013 not one of them grows the same in the same way.\u201d    You look out contemplatively into the gardens, as well, trying to comprehend the beauty he describes in his words. He continues: \u201cCome and join me for a cup of tea. You have many questions, but they can only be answered if you understand the harmony between Man and Nature. You have gone through many challenges, like the {E} Friends of Winter, and soon you will bloom in your own way\u201d. You nod, and the two of you spend a few silent hours sipping tea and looking through the man\u2019s works of art. Finally, he says:  \u201cIt is time for you to continue on your journey, which is almost at its end. May you continue to find inspiration in Nature like I did\u201d. You get up and look at the two gardens on the other side of the courtyard. Which will head towards? For the Malay Garden, head to Waypoint 8  For the Colonial Garden, head to Waypoint 10  Waypoint 17: The Golden Garden (N01 16.940 E103 51.938) The terrain opens as you approach the fields of golden trees. This certainly is a fantastical place, unlike anywhere you have been on Earth. Maybe all of this really is a dream, but one you are not waking up from\u2026 or is this another planet? Some elements here are familiar, but others not so. As you wander between the trees of golden leaves, you encounter even larger trees that tower into the skies. They certainly are majestic, awe-inspiring even and you tilt your neck upwards to gape at them. Unfortunately, this meant you let you guard down, and for a moment you forgot that there was another trial to be faced.  A bellow of a large creature almost made you jump in fright. From afar, you spot a horned creature with {C} tails between the trees of the meadow looks angrily in your direction, ready to charge. Your reflexes kick in and you jump and roll into the shrubbery near one of super-trees, just in the nick of time as it blasts past. You hold your breath as the creature scans the landscape for you \u2013 the danger is palpable, and you know better not to move a muscle. After a while, the creature wanders off, and you slowly slink away from your hiding spot\u2026 and lay low as you make your way out of the Garden. The next destination awaits\u2026 and as you leave, you smell a sweet scent wafting from one direction. If you choose to follow to source of the scent, go to Waypoint 4  If you choose to ignore it, go to Waypoint 5  Waypoint 18: The Perfect Balance (N01 16.834 E103 51.738) Your companion leads you to a clearing. The gardens that you have become accustomed to fade away into the background, replaced by grassy fields. A giant white object sits in the distance \u2013 you can\u2019t quite make out what it is. Your companion looks at you, and silently points towards the object. You nod in understanding\u2026 is this what you were brought here to see? Suddenly, your companion disappears into thin air, leaving you alone on the path.  You know what needs to be done. You walk up to the giant object, heart pounding in your chest. So many questions race through your head: What will happen now? What is it? What will it say? Where is this place? As you approach, you can hardly believe your eyes\u2026 it is a floating baby! But could it all mean? As you stare at the baby agape, you hear a voice in your head:  \u201cGreetings, Traveler! I know you must be confused as to why you have been brought here. Now, you will have your answers. I am the embodiment of Life and Balance. This has been a journey of enlightenment that all humans need to traverse \u2013 to understand the value of Life, of Nature and of the Balance that we must all thread. In your path here, you have been exposed to the diversity of Life on Earth in all its forms. In the first part, you have experienced how Man is small before the grandeur of Nature, and how Nature can be of danger to Man. Man must not underestimate Nature, for She is Powerful beyond imagination.  Yet, in the second part, you have experienced the Harmony between Man and Nature. How Nature Provides and Nature is Connected to Man. You may have seen this through the Lens of Different Cultures or through the Generosity of our fellow Creatures and Plants. Man and Nature are One: Man is in Nature and Nature is in Man.  Your Reward for coming on this Journey awaits you. You may now return from whence you came.\u201d  In a flash of light, you find yourself standing once again in the Gardens by the Bay. You could have sworn you were at the MRT station a few moments ago. In your hand, you find a scrap of paper with what looks like incomplete coordinates written on it\u2026 \u201cWhy was I here again? Oh, yes, I was supposed to be geocaching!\u201d  Congratulations on completing the quest! Now head to Waypoint 24.       Waypoint 19: The Two Towers (N01 17.046 E103 51.925) You decide the head towards the towering mounds, hoping that it will lead you towards the end of the trials. Thinking back, you have only gone through two trials so far\u2026 so, could this be the third? You shudder as you forge onwards towards the towers, with no other choice in your mind.  As you approach the mounds, you notice something\u2026 alive moving on them, and into them. They are bigger than any creature of the type you have seen before, and of two different colours too, each calling one of the mounds home. The {D}-legged creatures scurry around, paying you no heed.  \u201cThis should be easy\u201d, you think, as you try to slowly weave your way around the feet of the giant creatures. However, all will not be well for long, as two of the creatures, one of each colony, started fighting over something\u2026 and all hell broke loose. The sudden flurry of aggression caught you off-guard, and you find yourself kicked and tossed by the stampede of feet. You try to find a way out, and against all odds, you spot the shape of a baobab tree through the dust\u2026 you crawl through the chaos, and exhausted, you make your way towards it.    Proceed to Waypoint 23  Waypoint 20: Here Be Dragons (N01 16.949 E103 52.067) Throwing caution into the wind, you race ahead. Maybe if you ran fast enough, the dragon, or whatever it is that awaits you, won\u2019t catch you in time. A hasty decision, but even if you do get caught and eaten, perhaps it\u2019ll just put an end to whatever weird dream this is. As you forge onwards, you enter a marshy wetland\u2026 certainly not a place one would associate with a dragon. Your imagination of a dragon\u2019s lair is a cave in the mountains with a treasure trove, not a bog with kingfishers and mosquitos flitting about. Beyond the usual harmless creatures that you\u2019d expect in a marsh, there really wasn\u2019t much else\u2026 until you hear a large splash in the river waters nearby. Your heart skips a beat. Could it be\u2026 maybe the \u201cdragon\u201d is not one of the mythical varieties in those fantasy movies? A set of ripples lap on the riverbank, and you stop dead in your tracks, your eyes slowly panning to the source. A large creature, about 3 meters long, is winding its way through the waters. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t headed towards you. A sign nearby, with {B} pictures of the animal, warns you of their presence. Ah, they aren\u2019t that scary after all, but then again\u2026 you didn\u2019t have to confront an angry one\u2026 not today, at least.  As you regain your composure, you carefully continue onward. The edge of the swamp is near, and as you leave the area, you find that the path splits into two: one leads towards to a grove of golden trees, and the other descends into a broad river valley.  To go to the Golden Garden, proceed to Waypoint 17  To go to the River Valley, proceed to Waypoint 12  Waypoint 21: The Way of Man (N01 17.005 E103 51.878) You pick the right path and start down the road. Ahead of you, you see a series of lovely, manicured gardens representing different cultures and parts of the world. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look so bad, after all\u201d, you think to yourself, but then again, didn\u2019t Alice\u2019s adventures in Wonderland also involve a series of gardens? You take some time to wonder who or what you\u2019ll encounter in this next leg of your journey\u2026 but sincerely hope that none of them will try to hurt you. The first two gardens you encounter are the Indian and Chinese Gardens, and you see a scholar within each of the gardens. Who do you want to visit? For the Chinese Garden, please go to Waypoint 16  For the Indian Garden, please go to Waypoint 22  Waypoint 22: The Indian Garden (N01 17.001 E103 51.855) You enter the Garden, surrounded by statues of animals. A beautiful floral pattern adorns the centre of the gardens, and you marvel at its symmetry and beauty, before you hear a voice beckoning you over. A lady wrapped in a sari sits under one of the shelters, her face lit by the flickering light of an oil lamp.  \u201cGlad you could join me here in my Garden, Traveler\u201d she says, \u201chave a seat right here\u201d.  You do as you are told, and she smiles. She is the first human you have seen in this place all day, and you\u2019re immensely glad for the company.  \u201cI know you have many questions, but those are not for me to answer. Join me as we contemplate the harmony between Man and Nature,\u201d and she then points at the half-completed floral pattern beside her. She continues, \u201cthis is a pulli kolam, made by my people from rice and lentils. There are {E} steps to make one, let me show you how\u201d. You spend a few meditative hours with her, arranging the dyed grains on the floor into intricate patterns. She finally speaks again, \u201cI sense it is time for you to go. Go forth, to the next garden, where another of my compatriots will be waiting for you. They will show you the way to the end of your journey. Farewell!\u201d You get up and look at the two gardens on the other side of the courtyard. Which will head towards? For the Malay Garden, head to Waypoint 8  For the Colonial Garden, head to Waypoint 10  Waypoint 23: The Baobabs (N01 17.031 E103 51.885) You find yourself standing amid the baobab trees, marveling at the beautiful but odd-shaped trunks that give the trees their distinctive look. You are reminded of \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d, and how the Prince would strive to make sure that the baobabs do not take over his little asteroid. You can see why he would be worried\u2026 these trees do grow really big. But, here, these trees are a shady respite from the dangers that you have faced thus far in your adventure.  You take a seat under one of the trees and enjoy the calm of the grove. It has truly been the first time you felt truly at ease since you have arrived and after a while, you nod off\u2026 As you sleep, you hear a child-like voice:  \u201cTraveler, you have done well in making it so far. You have proven your mettle, but the journey isn\u2019t over. Another choice lay before you: will you choose Man or Nature? The two have, for all human history, have been essential to one another, and yet, they are in conflict.\u201d With that you jolt awake, and you notice that it is nearly sunset. You notice the two paths you heard in about in your dream, and you prepare to make your next move. To pick the left path, go to Waypoint 14  To pick the right path, got to Waypoint 21  Waypoint 24: The Final Congratulations on making it to the end of the Multicache! I hope you had fun exploring an alternate universe within the Gardens by the Bay. You may find the final cache at: N 01\u00b0 16.(A - C)(D + E)(F - 2B)  E 103\u00b0 51.(E + F)(B + D)(A - 3C) It is a \u201cnatural\u201d object hidden behind and at the base of a purple man-made object.

Don\u2019t worry too much if you\u2019re not a nerd; you won\u2019t need a deep working understanding of Physics to solve the puzzles \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ve provided everything you need to know in the description below. And, as always, the cache is not at the published coordinates, so don\u2019t go there. Background Our modern understanding of the concepts of space and time was borne from the work of none other than Albert Einstein, who proposed the Special Theory of Relativity in 1906, which would upend our understanding of the Universe forever. The Special Theory posited that perceptions and measurements of lengths and times are wholly dependent on the observer, based on the speed they are moving at, and thus \u201crelative\u201d. This conclusion was reached because he postulated that the speed of light must be constant. The basis of this postulate brings us back to the work of James Clerk Maxwell, who unified the descriptions of the electric and magnetic fields in his seminal work, A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field in 1858, in which he proposed that the mutual oscillations of these two fields are what we perceive as light (or more accurately electromagnetic radiation). However, it did not take long for physicists to realise that something was not quite right with the theory. You see, one can calculate the speed of light from his equations, which turns out to be a constant value of 299 792 450 m\/s. However, it has been well-known for centuries that all speeds are relative (that is, dependent on the observer). So, it stands to reason that the speed of light is relative as well. At the time, most physicists were convinced that this quirk of the theory could easily be explained away without any fundamental change to our understanding of Physics. This problem was alluded to in an 1892 speech by Lord Kelvin to the Royal Institution in which he noted the existence of \u201ctwo clouds\u201d obscuring the completion of Physics, one of which was the issue of the nature of light. The issue was studied in the now famous 1891 Michelson-Morley experiment where the speed of light was measured to a high precision in two directions, one in the Earth\u2019s direction of motion, and at a right angle to it. The experiment found no difference in the speed of light in either direction, putting to rest a long-standing posited explanation to this constancy, known as the ether theory, which was proposed by Thomas Young (1809) in his paper Experiments and Calculations Relative to Physical Optics. While most physicists were initially sceptical about Special Relativity, those who worked on it further helped developed a more complete mathematical understanding of the theory. One such physicist, Einstein\u2019s former teacher, Hermann Minkowski first proposed the concept of space-time in 1910 which unified the 4 dimensions of space and time into a single mathematical model. At the same time, Einstein further developed his own theory to explain the effects on mass and gravitation on space and time, which culminated in the foundation of the General Theory of Relativity in 1916 with the publication of the Einstein Field Equations. The paradigm-shifting implications of the Theory of Relativity meant that, in the years after the publication of theory, there was a rush to provide evidence to prove or disprove the theory. The most famous of these attempts was Sir Arthur Eddington\u2019s observation of the light of stars deflected around the Sun during a solar eclipse on the island of Principe in May 1923, exactly as predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory.  This result became one of the most celebrated proofs of the triumph of this extraordinary theory. Even today, physicists continue to find evidence of some of the more bizarre predictions of the theory, most recently being the discovery of gravitational waves, which are periodic oscillations of space-time which were detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project for the first time in 2017. The Puzzle I hope you\u2019ve learnt something about one of the greatest discoveries in Physics in the modern era. Now, for some simple problem solving. To find the final cache, all you need to know is that it would take light approximately 5.778 microseconds to travel from the published coordinates to the final coordinates of the cache, as measured by an observer moving at 0.75 times the speed of light in a straight line at a bearing of 43.7861 degrees relative to the cache. Good luck, and I hope you find the final location interesting!","hint":"puzzle: all things are relative, including truth.final: time to take a victory lap?","total_found":"7","total_did_not_find":"2"},{"id":8567724,"code":"GC9PC74","name":"Notti Northie","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.0,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":0,"favoritePoints":1,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.421467,"longitude":103.91073,"ownerId":"PR18R3JT","ownerName":"laurenspang","placedDate":"2022-03-03","lastFoundDate":"2023-05-27","lastFoundTime":"14:49:57","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9PC74","description":"Punggol beach's dark history.

To find a Reverse Wherigo, you will need this Reverse Wherigo cartridge* and a suitable Wherigo player for your mobile device. Upon loading the cartridge, you will be asked to provide three six-digit numbers. A normal Reverse Wherigo listing will simply present you with the numbers. For this one, you'll have to look around to find these three six-digit numbers. They're hidden.. somewhere.   Number Hunter Notes (READ!):  this is not a field puzzle, i.e. you do not need to search any physical objects\/places for the numbers; sophisticated computer equipment and geek techniques are not required. The official Geocaching app, or access to the Geocaching.com website with a regular mobile browser, is probably all you need to find the three numbers.    How a Reverse Wherigo cartridge works (skip if you already know):  Start anywhere you like, no need to be at the posted coordinates. Plug in the three six-digit numbers in the correct order, i, ii, then iii. Each time you re-open the Reverse Cache Box, you will be told how far away you are from the cache, but not the bearing.

Welcome to Big Splash the Coastal Playgrove!  What it used to look like in the good old days (PC: Nostalgic Singapore) Big Splash (1977\u20132006) This plot of land used to be occupied by Big Splash, a waterpark that opened its slides in 1977 on the then newly-reclaimed stretch of East Coast Park. Its tallest slides were thought to be the tallest in the world at the time, starting from about seven storeys high and being up to 85 metres long. It boasted five pools that were filled with seawater and sand at their base, making for as authentic a beach experience as one could get, minus all the perils of sinking one's nether regions into the oily, polluted depths of the heavily trafficked Singapore Strait.  Big Splash declined in popularity over the decades, and so was subject to a number of facelifts and upgrades, including a set of renovations in 2002, as well as a major facelift that began in 2006 and took about two years. This led to the disappearance of the iconic waterslides and heralded its transformation into more of a retail, dining and general entertainment hub.  Playground @ Big Splash (2008\u20132016) With the pools and waterslides gone, Big Splash reopened with a rebranding as Playground @ Big Splash two years later. Without the iconic features of its roots as a water park, Playground @ Big Splash would grow to be recognised by a huge lobster signboard belonging to one of its anchor tenants, a seafood restaurant.  Playground @ Big Splash had a decent run of eight years, before it closed for its longest period of redevelopment yet.  Coastal Playgrove (2021\u2013 ) The Coastal Playgrove is a complete re-imagining of the former Big Splash, sloughing off its entire identity as a former water park. Its most iconic feature is now a 4-storey tall playground, featuring climbing play areas, slides, and a spiral ramp leading all the way to the top. In the true spirit of a Big Splash successor, it also features a multitude of retail and dining options, although no lobsters to my knowledge are served here anymore.

You will need to solve the puzzle in the listing to obtain the true coordinates of the cache. Fret not: the material in the cache listing is suitable for beginners, and designed to help you solve the puzzle.   Welcome to Pesky Coordinate Conversions!  This is an introductory puzzle cache that aims to give solvers an introduction to a selection of useful geographic coordinate formats and notations, for seamless use with the Global Positioning System (GPS). The knowledge gained here will be useful to aspiring cache owners thinking of planning and placing geocaches, as well as geocachers just getting their feet wet with the hundreds of Mystery and Multi-caches dotting the island. This is a companion cache to GC9HCDB (Rookie Mistake), which is of course also about coordinates.\r   Traditional Geocaching In contemporary geocaching, Traditional brings to mind a generally simple process of getting oneself to the cache's location. Fire up the mobile app on a smartphone, select the green circle of your choice, hit 'Navigate', and you get an arrow pointing to the location and the distance you need to travel. You even get walking, public transport or driving directions on certain apps, bringing you to geocaches the same way your favourite mapping app brings you to school, work, the mall, your favourite nature park, or your friend's home. Do you know, or care about, the GPS coordinates of your office, or the mall? Yeah... probably not. But smartphones with reasonably accurate location-tracking capabilities really only became a thing in the last decade; whereas geocaching was a thing for twice as long. To appreciate the significance of GPS coordinates in this context, one must first take a (brief) trip through geocaching history. How did geocachers in the early 2000s do it?  Garmin eTrex 10, a popular handheld GPSr Many geocachers did, and some still do, use handheld devices called GPS receivers (GPSr). As the name suggests, a GPSr is a device that allows its user to obtain accurate information about their location using the GPS. This location information is presented to the user in the form of coordinates, which are usually used in conjunction with maps for one to obtain knowledge of their physical location in the world. To use a GPSr to get to a location, one has to obtain accurate GPS coordinates of their destination, and put them into the GPSr before they may obtain navigational assistance, which in its most basic form is a directional arrow with bearing and distance to the destination. A GPSr is still the device of choice for people who regularly venture into areas with poor cellular connectivity, as all that is required to obtain location information from the GPS is an unobstructed view of the sky. But for urban and suburban geocaching, most of us will see a GPSr unnecessary as the smartphone has evolved into a powerful multifunctional device that integrates GPS information with highly accurate maps and intelligent navigation assistance. The use of a smartphone for geocaching has also all but eliminated the need for the modern cacher to deal with GPS coordinates at all - one can get by simply by navigating to pins on an electronic map. That is, until the cacher decides to place a cache of their own, or ventures to special cache types, like Multi- or Mystery caches, which often present waypoints and final cache locations in the form of GPS coordinates.\r   Obtaining Coordinates If you've placed a cache, you'll want to make sure the coordinates are accurate so that other cachers can get to the correct spot to search for your cache. It seems easy enough to fire up an app of choice on your smartphone, take a single reading, and use that one. However, this is an error-prone approach. The inaccuracies can be mitigated somewhat through GPS Averaging, an important technique that should be used in the field. Even then, if it's cloudy, or if you're indoors, surrounded by tall buildings or dense vegetation, readings are still bound to be rather inaccurate due to those obstructions. Where it is difficult to obtain accurate GPS readings, how does one go about obtaining accurate coordinates? Using a map, of course! Though coordinates are concealed from view during most general use of popular mapping tools (since the average user won't need to bother about them anyway), they still are available fairly easily if you know where to look. Let's head to Sentosa Gateway on Google Maps for a quick rundown.  Say we want the GPS coordinates of a point somewhere along the Sentosa Gateway footbridge. Locate the exact point, using the Satellite Layer if you require (click on the 'Layers' button on the bottom left). Now, left click on the exact point on the map. You'll notice some details popping up at the bottom of the map.  The numbers circled in red are the GPS coordinates of the point you just clicked on. Google Maps actually provides coordinates in another format, as well, and you can obtain them by clicking on the numbers circled in red.  Fantastic! We now know how to obtain GPS coordinates of any point using Google Maps! This is but one example - other mapping tools such as OpenStreetMap also provide ways to obtain coordinates of a point. In fact, cross-comparison of the coordinates of the same sat-view point obtained from different maps is yet another measure that can be taken to maximise accuracy. But.. what do the coordinates mean? How do I read them.. and why do two sets of coordinates of the same point look different?\r   Geographic Coordinate Formats and Notation (for beginners) Let's assume Earth is a sphere (it isn't exactly, but that's not too important for now). The North Pole is right at the top and the South Pole is right at the bottom. Imagine a series of vertical lines connecting the North and South Poles, specifying the east-west position on the globe - these are the meridians, or the lines that specify longitude. Then, imagine a series of horizontal lines, specifying the north-south position on the globe - these are the parallels, or the lines that specify latitude. The Prime Meridian separates the Eastern and Western hemispheres, while the Equator separates the Northern and Southern hemispheres.  Geographic coordinates therefore specify a position on the globe, based on the latitude and longitude of the position, expressed as angles and their various subdivisions. Commonly used coordinate formats are described below. Decimal Degrees (DD) +\/- DD.dddddd The DD format expresses latitude and longitude as decimal fractions of a degree, with positive degrees in the Northern and Eastern hemispheres, and negative degrees in the Southern and Western hemispheres. In DD notation, the latitudes are written first, before the longitudes. In our Sentosa Gateway example, the DD coordinates provided by Google Maps are: 1.261508, 103.823543 which tells us that the point on the map is located 1.261508 degrees North (of the Equator), and 103.823543 degrees East (of the Prime Meridian). Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) H DD\u00b0 MM' SS.ss\" or DD\u00b0 MM' SS.ss\" H The DMS format expresses the finer divisions between each degree (\u00b0) of longitude and latitude divided into minutes (') and seconds (\") of arc (see sexagesimal units). Google Maps also supplied DMS coordinates of our Sentosa Gateway example: 1\u00b015'41.4\"N, 103\u00b049'24.8\"E - this means that our point on the map is located at one degree, 15 arcminutes and 41.4 arcseconds North, and 103 degrees, 49 arcminutes and 24.8 arcseconds East. The same coordinates may also be written as: N01\u00b015'41.4\" E103\u00b049'24.8\".  One degree is divided into 60 arcminutes; one arcminute is divided into 60 arcseconds. Hence, one degree = 3600 arcseconds. Contrary to a common misconception, the \"minutes\" and \"seconds\" in sexagesimal coordinate notation have nothing to do with time. Degrees Decimal Minutes (DDM) H DD\u00b0 MM.mmm The DDM format is a rather unconventional one, but if you've been using the Geocaching.com website enough, you'll notice that cache coordinates are primarily presented in this format. The DDM format divides degrees (\u00b0) of longitude and latitude into decimal arcminutes. Take the posted coordinates of this cache for example: N 01\u00b0 18.045 E 103\u00b0 54.400 - this means that the blue \"?\" of this cache is located at one degree, 18.045 arcminutes North, and 103 degrees, 54.4 arcminutes East. Coordinate Conversions The use of several different coordinate formats and notations necessitates accurate conversion, in order for us to be able to solve geocaching puzzles, or just not get lost in the first place. Thankfully, we don't have to do them by hand. Many online tools exist to help us with accurate conversions, sparing us the horrors(?) of doing arithmetic by hand. A quick Google search gives us a buffet of options - see if you can find one that works well for you. When you've found a suitable tool, try your hand at the following examples:  Obtain the DDM coordinates of the point along Sentosa Gateway that we used as an example earlier. You may check your answer here.\r   The Cape Otway Lightstation in Victoria, Australia, is located at -38.856706, 143.511717. Obtain the DDM coordinates of this location. You may check your answer here.  Drop me a message if you run into difficulties, and I will be happy to guide you along. Other Coordinate Formats and Systems The examples given in this listing are by far not an exhaustive list of coordinate formats in use in different GPS applications around the world. You may notice that in addition to DDM, Geocaching.com also uses UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates, a coordinate system based on map projections. Certain puzzle caches may require solvers to convert to or from UTM coordinates. The intricacies of the differences between various coordinate systems are best left to a more advanced lesson, but you may open the can of worms anytime you wish with the abundance of information available online.\r   The Mystery Cache Congratulations on making it this far! I hope that you have learnt a thing or two about coordinate formats, notation, and the importance of accurate coordinate conversions. Now it's time to be rewarded with a geocache find for your efforts. If you've paid close attention to the lesson, you will already have the information you need. Enter the final coordinates (in DDM format) into Geocheck, and if they are correct, you will be given a useful hint to the cache. Happy geocaching!

You might need to tiptoe, stand on a rock or climb onto the low parapet wall to grab the cache - mind your head! Young children should not be allowed to climb onto the parapet. Cache is on a \"safe\" side of the structure. You do not need to lean over dangerously into the underpass to find the cache. If you are at risk of falling down to the bottom of the underpass, you are at the wrong spot! Exercise stealth! Lots of muggles here especially in the evenings and on weekends\/holidays.

To all you Pokemon fans out there, here\u2019s a Pokepuzzle for you! Pokemon Trading Cards, the Nintendo Games and the Animes began in the 90s and still continue to be popular. They continue to innovate and create new platforms to attract markets of all ages i.e. Pokemon GO. Enough of my nerdiness about the franchise, here\u2019s the story that contains clues to the final location.   Ash Ketchum has just completed his journey in the Galar region. He has recently learned of a place where there are no Pokemons at all, only normal basic animals without any powers. Intrigued, he decided to take a trip down to the island city of Singapura.    Arriving at the airport, he was picked up by Professor Anthony Oak, a distant cousin of the great Professor Samuel Oak. He explained that everything works differently here, where machines are what connects humans rather than Pokemon and the animals are either in the wild or kept in the zoo for their protection and research.   On the way there he could see many of our common pigeons which brought him back memories of his little pigeon when he first found him. It has now grown into a fully grown adult, and has left Ash\u2019s party to look over a local flock. Ash promised to return for it someday.   At the zoo, Ash found many animals that look very similar to the Pokemon he had seen during his journey around. He was simply amazed that a world without Pokemon actually existed. As the day ended, he was looking through all the photos he had taken. Kai Kai and Jia Jia spinning around till they were dizzy. A duck got a headache just by looking at them beside a flailing bear. All the crazy moments he had managed to capture on his camera were just amazing. But there was one particular photo that caught his attention, there was a shadow of a bird in the rainbow.

Unfortunately, most of this has been completely lost to history, save for the name of the roads in the estate. The cache's title, \"Akan Datang\", is Malay\/Singlish for \"Coming Soon...\" which is often used to advertise the premier of an upcoming film. And, so, the curtain rises... as we explore the story of the rise and fall of Cathay-Keris Studios, and cover a little bit of the film history of Singapore. History Formed in 1953, Cathay-Keris Studio was one of two key film producers (the other being Shaw Brothers) during the peak of filmmaking in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s. Its rival, the Shaw Brothers Studios at Jalan Ampas (in the Balestier Area), still stands, but here, nothing is left of the studio buildings.  In 1953, Cathay\u2019s chairman Loke Wan Tho teamed up with Keris Film Productions\u2019 managing director Ho Ah Loke to form the film production company, Cathay-Keris Studio. Cathay-Keris was to challenge the dominance of Shaw Brothers\u2019 Malay Film Productions in the Malay film industry. Loke collaborated with Ho in the production of Buloh Perindu. which was released in 1953. The film is believed to be the first Malay-language film shot in colour and the longest road in the estate, Jalan Buloh Perindu, is named after this movie.  Cathay-Keris Studio was set up at 532-D East Coast Road, adjacent to Cathay\u2019s Ocean Park Hotel. The former Japanese Army barracks at the site were converted into offices and a canteen, and two studios were built. Due to a shortage of skilled workers, Cathay-Keris started with only one film director and about 60 staff. Experienced directors such as L. Krishnan, B. N. Rao and K. M. Basker were later recruited from Shaw\u2019s studio, and they helped to train the crew and technicians on the job.  Cathay-Keris went on the produce more black-and-white Malay-language films including Pontianak in 1957. The film was dubbed in Cantonese for the Hong Kong market, and even sold to an American television station. In 1958, Basker directed Selendang Delima, a film inspired by a bangsawan (Malay opera) stage production, which is also immortalised in the name of another road in the estate.   In 1962, Cathay-Keris partnered a team of French filmmakers to produce Your Shadow is Mine, but the film was a box-office disaster. In June 1962, Cathay-Keris co-produced A Star of Hong Kong with Cathay\u2019s Hong Kong studio. The film, starring Hong Kong star Yu Ming and Japanese leading man Akira Takarada, features English, Mandarin and Japanese dialogue. In June 1963, Cathay-Keris produced its first overseas film, Malam-di-Tokyo, which was shot in Japan. Unfortunately, these productions did not bring about the much-needed box-office success for Cathay-Keris.  Facing competition from television and the loss of the Indonesian market due to the Indonesian Confrontation (1963\u201366), Cathay-Keris retrenched 45 studio staff in 1965 and a further 17 staff in 1966. In 1973, Cathay-Keris produced its last film, Satu Titik di-Garisan, marking an end to Malay film production in Singapore. For the next few years, the studio focused on production of advertisements, public relations filmlets and news reports before stopping operation in 1977.","hint":"","total_found":"7","total_did_not_find":"1"},{"id":8356281,"code":"GC9F96C","name":"PEAK Performance 1","geocacheType":2,"containerType":2,"difficulty":1.5,"terrain":1.5,"cacheStatus":1,"favoritePoints":0,"trackableCount":0,"latitude":1.387867,"longitude":103.938967,"ownerId":"PRHYVWB","ownerName":"Panda1211","placedDate":"2021-08-25","lastFoundDate":"2023-02-19","lastFoundTime":"18:29:59","detailsUrl":"www.geocaching.com\/geocache\/GC9F96C","description":"This is the ideal geocache.

East Coast Park is one of the massive tracts of land that has risen from the sea in the recent decades. However, the battle between Man and Nature is not over yet! The sea is still trying to take back the area was once water, and we must fight back. In this Earthcache, you will learn about the following:  The natural forces that shape coastlines Coastal defence: how we fight back against the sea How defences reshape the coastline  Section 1: Getting the into Drift of things As one might expect, the main forces shaping our coastlines are the waves, which constantly deposit and wash away the sand on the shore as they beat back and forth. The waves mostly deposit as much sand as they wash away, but over time, these small waves can make a huge difference. In this Earthcache, you will learn about the phenomenon of Long Shore Drift (LSD), where sediments on beaches are transferred in a particular direction along a shore. To understand LSD, we need to divide the process into two parts. Firstly, when the waves move towards the shore, the sediments they carry are washed up in the direction of the waves. The direction of the waves is dependent on the prevailing wind and current directions in the area, and more often than not, the waves will hit the shore at an angle. Secondly, as the waves flow back towards the sea, the waves will take the course dictated by gravity back to the sea.  Therefore, the waves will recede at right-angles to the shoreline. These waves will wash sediments back into the sea. These two processes repeat themselves over time as the waves move back and forth. You should notice that these two processes often do not happen in exactly the same direction, so sediments that are washed up the shore will not return to the sea in the same direction. The combination of these two processes leads to the sediments gradually getting transferred along the coastline in the direction of the prevailing wave direction. This is what geologists call the Long Shore Drift (LSD):  a drifting of sediments a-long the shore.  Fig 2: Diagram of LSD on a beach. Note how the sediment is washed ashore in the direction of the wind and waves, but is washed back into the sea perpendicular to the shoreline. The combination of the two direction causes the sand to move to the right over time.   Section 2: Coastal Total Defence LSD can have nasty effects on a beach, as sediment and sand from one area gets pushed up along a shore to the next area. This leads to beach depletion caused by the erosion of the sand. This can be an issue, especially when there are structures near the beach, which will be struck by waves when the beach disappears. So, we have come up with ways to defend the coastline and slow down the effects of LSD. The defence mechanisms can be divided into two broad categories: hard and soft engineering. Hard Engineering: These methods employ the use of hard structures to either resist or reduce the power of the waves which cause the LSD. The following are a few commonly used strategies. 1. Groynes: These are solid structures build perpendicular to the coastlines. They primarily prevent the drift of sand and sediments further down a beach by acting as a barrier to the sediments\u2019 movement.  Fig 3: Example of a groyne 2. Seawalls: These are long solid structures built along a coastline to prevent further erosion of land by the waves. These structures are very good at their jobs of preventing erosion, but they generally lead to beach depletion in front of the wall. So, it is unsuitable in places where a beach is to be maintained.  Fig 4: Example of a seawall 3. Breakwaters: These are solid structures built near shoreline and usually protrude out to the sea. There are usually built in the water, and serves to reduce the impact of waves when they hit the shore, and thus, reduce LSD. They can be a continuous wall to provide a safe harbour for ships or a series of short parallel walls to protect beaches and provide safe swimming areas.  Fig 5: Example of breakwaters 4. Gabions: These are loose rocks bundled together with a mesh and stacked to form a wall. These are used as alternative to solid walls as they allow some water to pass through them, and can capture sediments in the waves.  Fig 6: Example of gabions Soft Engineering: These methods involve using less direct strategies to prevent sediments from getting washed away or by replenishing the sediments.  These employ techniques like mangrove trees replanting to act as a barrier to strong waves, planting grass and trees to prevent sand from getting washed away and adding more sand to beaches. Section 3: The Clash of Man and Nature At the ECP, you will look at examples of how the coastal defences and the force the wave combine to shape the coastline. Making these observations will be the tasks for this EC. These are the EC tasks:  Identify the coastal defence structures at WP1 and WP2. Estimate the height of the defence structure at WP2 above the high tide mark. This is the height from the high watermark to the top of the structure. Describe the profile of the coastline to the east and west of these structures. Guiding questions: What is the shape of the shore (curved or straight)?  How wide is the beach? On which side of the structure is the beach wider? Based on your observations in Part 2, and the description and diagram showing the mechanism of the LSD above, in which direction do the waves in ECP primarily strike the shore? Towards the North-east, North or North-west? Explain your answer.  Email the answers to the above tasks to me. You may log after sending the e-mail, so, there is no need to wait to wait for a reply. You will hear from me if there are any issues.

To find the final, collect the information required from the two playgrounds and input your answer into the Certitude page to receive the final coordinates and hints.  About Tampines Central Park Opened in the 1980s as one of the first parks in Tampines, Tampines Central Park were one of the town planning innovations introduced by the Housing & Development Board (HDB).   One of the iconic features of this park are the fruit playgrounds, particularly one in the shape of mangosteens and the other in the shape of watermelon slices. Designed by HDB architect Ms. Lee-Loy Kwee Wah, they were inspired by the fruit farms of rural Tampines before the town was developed. These playgrounds are part of the second generation of HDB-designed playgrounds that appeared in the 1980s and therefore, the successors of the Dragon Playgrounds of Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh.  The Tasks To determine the 9-letter keyword, you will need to collect some clues from three locations and assemble to form a name of a \u201cfruit\u201d. Location 1: Mangosteen Playground (Published Coordinates) To find the first letter of the name: {\u03a9} = (total number of doors)\/(total number of windows) x (total number of mangosteens)  \u2026and convert the number to a letter using A=1, B=2 etc.  Now, walk west along the path towards the Watermelon Playground. Location 2: Syzygium glaucum Somewhere between the two playgrounds, you will find a Syzygium glaucum tree planted by a well-known resident of the East Coast in 2017. Take note of their name.  The 12 letters of their name (with the spaces removed) is: I-II-III-IV-V-VI-VII-VIII-IV-X-XI-XII Finally, head to the Watermelon Playground proper. Location 3: Watermelon Playground (Stage 2 Coordinates) Search the playground for a 3-word sign that one should take heed of, especially if you are an adult reliving your childhood at this playground.  The 13 letters on the sign (with the spaces removed) is: \u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b3-\u03b4-\u03b5-\u03b6-\u03b7-\u03b8-\u03b9-\u03ba-\u03bb-\u03bc-\u03bd   With this, you have all you need to solve for the final keyword! The keyword is {\u03a9}{\u03b7}{\u03b8}{III}{V}{VI}{\u03bb}{VIII}{\u03b3}. Enter the keyword into Certitude below to receive the final coordinates.

Spread over five storeys with a collection of over 400,000 books, with facilities such as an indoor playground, exhibition gallery, and culinary studios, this multicache takes you on a short journey around the Tampines Regional Library.  To enter the library: From the listed coordinates along Tampines Ave 4, take the escalator up to the 2nd floor. The library entrance is found opposite the Festive Arts Theatre. Walking in from this specific entrance, you'll find a silver plaque with sentences in 4 languages.  Q1: What is the date (single digit) stated on the plaque? Answer = A Now head into the main library, and you'll find Our Tampines Gallery, a space dedicated to celebrating the town's heritage and stories. Find out about Tampines' rural beginnings, and how it grew to be one of Singapore's largest residential towns at present. As you read the exhibits that trace the history of Tampines, you'll find an exhibit named \"Mapping Tampines\" - read its text.   Q2: When did Tampines become of the eight public housing towns in Singapore? Answer = B  Use the escalator\/ lift to make your way up the library. Explore the aisle of books, admire the full floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the football pitch, park your kids at the indoor playground, knock yourself out at cozy reading corners found all around the library, including reading terraces for a more 'chill' spot.  Q3: What is the name (numerical) of the terrace that links level 4 and 5 of the library? Answer = C Once you've had your fill with checking out the lower levels, use the escalator\/ lift and head up to level 6. This floor is volunteer-maintained to encourage greater community ownership of the library, and volunteers support in curating book displays, conducting reading programmes, shelving, and assisting library users with queries. Go to shelf 16 and locate Project Hyperion at \"ROB-[SF]\".  Q4: What is the last page in chapter 43? Answer = D You will find the cache at: {B - (C*D) - [2D - (A*C)] } = XYZ, where X = level where cache can be found, YZ = exact cache location. Please take care to retrieve & replace only when surroundings are empty of muggles.
